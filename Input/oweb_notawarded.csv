In 2013 through our OSWB County Grant we treated many county properties and it became apparent to the LCCWMA that Dyer's woad was really beginning to spread throughout the town of Lakeview and the Goose Lake Basin, as well as, one site spreading into the Warner Weed Prevention Ares. Dyer's woad produces large amounts of seed and can be very hard to control once established.  The timing to for treatment is narrow.  Therefore, we plan to advertise and involve the community in locating unknown infestations, pinning treatment down to the most optimal time.

The four-foot drop from the outfall of the two culverts creates a complete barrier to fish passage. Each culvert is undersized and frequently blocked by logs and debris, causing the stream to flow over the road during less than 50-year flood events and resulting in downstream scour down to bedrock. The solution is to replace the culverts with a clear span railcar bridge. Replacing the culverts will improve stream process and function, reduce potential road sediments from entering the stream, and open approximately 3.7 miles of spawning and rearing habitat for native winter steelhead, coho salmon, resident and coastal cutthroat trout, Pacific and brook lamprey, and possibly Chinook salmon.

Four fish passage barriers would be addressed including three undersized culverts (one with a significant drop on downstream end) and one headcut. Two of the four locations are complete barriers, with the other two sites being partial barriers during certain times of the year. The three culverts would be replaced with bottomless pipe arch culverts that meet ODFW fish passage requirements for steelhead; and the headcut would be corrected by the installation of a stream simulated riffle creating stability between the transitions of channel gradient. Partners on this project are the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (CTWS) and the Wheeler SWCD. "215-6023,11368,6,0,Restoration,Wheeler SWCD,Soil and Water Conservation District,Indian Creek Diversions & Pipeline,Sue Greer,,,,Wheeler,150985,0,0,0,0,,,,John Day,Restoration,Not Awarded,0,0,"This project site is located on Indian Creek, a tributary of Mountain Creek in the southeast corner of Wheeler County. Mountain Creek and its significant tributaries are considered important spawning and rearing habitat for ESA listed summer steelhead. The three irrigation diversions on this section of Indian Creek exist as barriers for aquatic species during certain times of the year; they are not screened so stranding fish is a concern, and water quality is hampered when ditch conveyances fail. This proposal would replace the upper and middle diversions with fish-friendly irrigation structures and decommission the lower diversion. The system will be designed to divert the majority of the irrigation water right from the middle diversion and the associated ditch converted to pipe. The upper diversion would continue to divert to an open ditch but at lesser amounts. Partners on the project include the landowner, NRCS, ODFW and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (CTWS). "215-6027,11380,6,0,Restoration,Wheeler SWCD,Soil and Water Conservation District,Upper Bridge Creek Watershed Improvement,Sue Greer,,,,Wheeler,130699,0,0,0,0,,,,John Day,Restoration,Not Awarded,0,0,"The project site is located in the upper Bridge Creek watershed, southeast of the town of Mitchell in Wheeler County. Fire suppression and historic land use practices have encouraged western juniper to extend out of its normal range into riparian areas and upland deep soil sites, crowding out native vegetation, increasing topsoil loss by erosion from overland flows, and decreasing groundwater reserves. This project would fund the removal of 400 acres of juniper and non-commercially thin 55 acres of overstocked Ponderosa pine. This work would complement an additional 440 acres of juniper removal funded by the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (CTWS) and 80 acres of non-commercial thinning funded by NRCS. Partners on this project include CTWS and Wheeler SWCD."215-6028,11383,6,0,Technical Assistance,The Freshwater Trust,Corporation / Partnership,Rowe Creek Floodplain Restoration Preliminary Design,Sue Greer,,,,Wheeler,49548,0,0,0,0,,,,John Day,TA - 1,Not Awarded,0,0,"The site of this proposed technical assistance for design is located at the floodplain and confluence of Rowe Creek and the mainstem John Day River near the town of Twickenham in Wheeler County. Issues and concerns at the site that limit fish production include 1) limited fish migration passage into and upstream in Rowe Creek; 2) limited or reduced floodplain connectivity; 3) lack of channel and floodplain habitat complexity; 4) poor riparian vegetation conditions; 5) high summer instream water temperature; and 6) low instream flow.  Causal factors for these problems are prior conversion of historically complex habitat to agricultural production, including levee construction, floodplain grading, vegetation removal, tributary channelization, and water withdrawal. This TA would develop action alternatives and preliminary designs for new alignment and geomorphology of lower Rowe Creek for improved fish passage and habitat conditions, levee removal along the JDR downstream of the Rowe Creek confluence, wetland enhancement and possibly off-channel habitat creation through the construction of a backwater channel. The Freshwater Trust and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs were partners on this proposal.

As the Wallowa Whitman National Forest was completing the Watershed Restoration Action Plan for this watershed, they realized there was little to no baseline data available. This request would fund data collection for flow, temperature, turbidity, macro invertebrates, redd counts, and stream profiles for one-year of baseline and four years post project implementation to show effectiveness/changes after restoration projects are implemented. Partners include the North Fork John Day Watershed Council, the Wallowa Whitman National Forest and the Confederated Tribes Indian Reservation of Umatilla (CTUIR).

The 1994 Reed and 1996 Summit stand-replacing fires burned over 40,261 acres. Both sites were extensively replanted and along with natural regeneration resulted in a very dense, 15-20 year even-aged forest with extremely heavy fuel loads. These conditions provide for increased fire hazard, with a high probability that another fire would again be high intensity and stand replacing, scorching riparian areas and damaging soil health. Partners on the project include Malheur National Forest, North Fork John Day Watershed Council, NE Oregon Forests Resource Advisory Title II, and the Region 6 Competitive Challenge Cost Share.

The B3 line of the Hermiston Irrigation District (HID) is a 105 year old open ditch and leaking concrete pipe that services inefficient flood irrigation systems. Pollution of tailwater from the flood irrigated livestock pastures and cropland into ditches and drains running into the Columbia River is a major concern. Since 1999, HID has been proactively and successfully converting old concrete or open ditches to buried pipe and working toward a closed water delivery system. This project would install 11,640 of PVC pipe and delivery points for the water users of the B3 line. As a requirement of the line improvement, all water users would be required to convert their flood irrigation to efficient sprinkler systems. Partners on this project are Umatilla SWCD and the Hermiston Irrigation District.
