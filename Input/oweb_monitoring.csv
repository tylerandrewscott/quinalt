Populations of grassland birds and their associated plant communities have steadily declined in the valley over the past 40 years because of land conversion, natural succession, and land management practices that have degraded the communities. Oregon’s state bird, the western meadowlark, has become rare throughout the valley. Like other grassland birds, their diet is composed mostly of seeds and invertebrates that depend on many different and vanishing native plant species. The applicant proposes to restore 392 acres strategically located in and around core meadowlark populations. Treatments will convert agricultural fields into suitable prairie habitat and increase habitat connectivity between restoration sites and core breeding sites.  Effectiveness monitoring will help evaluate grassland bird response to habitat restoration while vegetation monitoring will document rates of establishment of native species. Pairing bird and vegetation monitoring will help determine key habitat characteristics that will guide the creation of new habitat. OWEB funds will be used primarily for in-house personnel, supplies and materials, and effectiveness monitoring.  "

The eastern side of this ranch is an arid landscape with little or no water available in the uplands. This is contributed to both the natural geology of the area and the encroachment of Western juniper. Pre-treatment inventories were conducted on the two selected sites for juniper removal and all sites were found to be phase two moving into phase three, showing skeletonized shrub components and loss of vegetation between trees. The landowners have fenced livestock off of Rudio Creek and are involved in extensive riparian restoration. Because this is a working ranch, the upland water sources on the east side are critical to implementing best managed grazing practices. A grazing plan was created that reverses the historic pasture rotation, effectively benefiting the grassland resources, improving overall plant health and reducing noxious weed impacts. But without eastside water availability, the improved grazing rotation doesn’t work.

The LWC, in a strong and productive partnership with the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department (OPRO), has been actively engaged in floodplain revegetation on over 80-acres at the LSNA since late 2010. Work to date has included mowing, cutting, strategic weed treatments and the installation of over 122,000 native woody plant seedlings. The LWC has also collected inundation data to help identify small floodplain reconnection opportunities and is making progress toward building community support around the LSNA. While the LWC is proud of the progress made to date with our OPRD partners, we are eager to increase the project scope and scale. The reestablishment of appropriate plant communities would provide improved forage and cover for birds and other wildlife and enhanced vegetation cover and diversity in frequently nundated areas on the floodplain.

This 35,000 acre watershed provides important habitat for spring Chinook, rainbow trout, winter steel head, cutthroat trout, and lamprey. Riparian forests have been lost as land has been converted to other uses, including agriculture, pasture, and rural residential development. The remaining riparian buffers are minimal in extant and lack native plant species diversity, and thus are not providing adequate bank stabilization, shade, and large wood and organic material inputs to  the creek. Non-native species, including Armenian and European blackberry and reed canarygrass have become dominant in the understory and are outcompeting native species. Invasive knotweed populations that were controlled 7 years ago are beginning to expand again. Lost Creek and its tributaries regularly exceed state benchmarks for water temperature and dissolved oxygen. These factors result in a reduction in the diversity and value of habitats available for sensitive native aquatic and terrestrial species, and negatively impact other ecosystem services provided by riparian  buffers. We propose to work with 12 private landowners and the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department to create or enhance riparian forest on 32 acres within the Lost Creek Watershed. Invasive species will be controlled using mechanical and chemical treatments, and native trees and shrubs will be planted in high densities and maintained for at least 5 years or until they reach the 'free to grow' stage. In several locations where localized streambank erosion is a problem due to a lack of vegetation, streambank soil bioengineering approaches will be employed. Riparian fencing will be installed at selected sites.

Irrigation water is diverted from the Umatilla River through the Maxwell Canal and the M-Line and on into the T-Line which serves 18 patrons. This project addresses water quantity and groundwater and surface water quality. The T-Line ditch was built in the early 1900’s, operating today in the original, open concrete lined canal, using a siphoning system and requiring an overflow pond. The current system wastes water and creates a potential for groundwater and surface water contamination through seepage, breakouts, and the excess draining from the pond out to the Columbia River. The overflow pond is the result of having to keep open canal charged with water so users have access to their water rights. The other issue of water quality results from toxins entering the irrigation canal from chemical weed control along the canal, currently necessary due to the eroded and uneven bank structures and broken concrete which prevents mowing the canal berms. Overspray from those chemicals, as well as adjacent field crop spraying, all enter the irrigation open canal. Once the system is converted to a 7,500’ closed, piped system, it is estimated that 5-7 cfs less water will need to be diverted to fulfill the rights of the 18 patrons; herbicides from weed treatments will no longer be polluting the canal water; and chemical treatment for mosquitos will be reduced once pond is eliminated.

Little Fall Creek is a low- to moderate-gradient dam-free stream to the Willamette River. Historically, past management practices of the watershed included splash damming, log drives, stream cleaning, and riparian forest harvesting. To facilitate log transport during log drives, large wood and boulders were removed from the channel, which resulted in a loss of channel complexity, including natural structures that could slow velocities, trap gravel, and maintain side channels and channel-floodplain connectivity. These conditions have minimized essential habitat necessary for fish populations with losses of juvenile rearing habitat, refugia from high velocity flows, and spawning habitat.

The proposed solution is to 1) inject key wood complexity (33 log structures over 2.5 miles) to trap and store mobile bedload that keeps low summer flows moving subsurface through a gravel lens, instead of passing over exposed bedrock; 2) increase off-channel winter habitat with reconnection to one historic alcove site; and 3) reduce solar impacts and increase long-term large wood recruitment.
