Hardwood conversion and conifer plantings are needed to provide future large wood replacement and shade along salmonid bearing streams.   Healthy riparian zones provide bank stability, control/moderate temperature, provide food for aquatic organisms and recruit large woody debris (LWD) to increase habitat in streams.  This project will be implemented along the  North Fork Klaskanine River which has moderate to undesirable levels of in-stream LWD per the Young's Bay Watershed Assessment (2000) and low to medium shading conditions.  The approximately five acres (seven landowners) to be planted with Sitka spruce, Douglas fir and Western hemlock have been treated for the highly invasive Japanese knotweed funded by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.

Invasive species threaten both the native habitat and previous restoration activities.  Research has shown the most effective eradication methods include three manual treatments.  Previous treatments have been funded by Oregon State Weed Board and Recreational Equipment Incorporated.  This project will continue manual removal of the weed over 100 acres including a 3rd cycle on 66 acres, a 2nd cycle on 23 acres and extend treatment to 11 more acres.

The long term results showed that the baffle equipped culverts do in fact allow fish passage, even though the fish in the study areas did not appear to move a great deal in any part of the study reaches.  The short term results indicated a definite improvement in the ability of juvenile steelhead trout to move upstream after the addition of certain baffle configurations.  Measurement of hydraulic conditions showed that the baffles do create areas of lower flow velocity, deepen flow and create resting pools.  These observations indicate that fish can and do move through culverts retrofitted with baffles and that the addition of baffles can improve the ability of juvenile fish (especially steelhead trout) to move upstream through a culvert.",,,,,,,

The water shortage has been identified in the Executive Summary of the 2008 Yamhill County Water Supply Analysis.  As th  county population grows and  more wells are drilled in the uplands they will continue to drain the aquifer and make groundwater more limited.  Despite normally abundant rainfall in the lower Willamette Basin, most of the water runs off the soils into the waterways rather than recharging the aquifer.  A typical cattle operation can use up to 100 gallons of water per head per day.  This project will develop a roof water harvesting system using rainwater storage tanks for use in a wildlife watering system.  It's estimated that this system will save about 162,000 gallons of water per year from being pumped out of the aquifer.

Removal of the invasive species will allow additional native species to re-enter the area to increase diversity and enhance wildlife habitat.  Additionally, the native plants should increase shade along the stream as well as filter out nutrients and pesticides before they enter the creek to improve water quality.  The homeowner's association has committed to an additional five years of maintenance including control of invasive species,  care of the new plants and a photographic record of the project.",,,,,,,

Richmond Forest is a privately owned 550 acre coniferous forest.  Bear Pear Wetland is a wetland seep that was re-contoured several decades ago to create a seasonal pond.  A small earthen dam is now partially breached to reduce the level of water retained during the winter months.  The wetland is now dominated by invasive, non-native Reed canary grass and Himalayan blackberry.  This greatly diminishes its habitat value for songbirds and such species as the red-legged tree frog which relies on wetlands for reproduction and upland forest for other stages of its life cycle. This project will remove the invasives by mowing and the use of hand tools followed by the application of shade cloth over a full growing season to suppress growth from rhizomes.  Once the cloth is removed, the area will be seeded with native sedges, rushes and grasses and planted with water tolerant shrubs and trees at the wet meadow/woodland interface.  Post-treatment of invasives and additional seeding and planting is planned.  Project partners include Tualatin River WSC , Hyla Woods and Pacific University staff, faculty and volunteers. ",,,,,,,

Invasive aquatic plants are particularly problematic since they are often more difficult to detect, control and eradicate than terrestrial invasive plants.  Excessive growth of submersed aquatic vegetation can clog turbines and irrigation canals; alter flow patterns, water chemistry, and nutrient cycling in lakes, reservoirs and streams; and can prevent beneficial uses such as fishing, boating and swimming. Approximately 10% of Oregon’s “A” and “B” listed noxious weeds are aquatic or obligate wetland species.  Many of these weeds are either not yet known in Oregon or have very limited distributions.  This project focuses on early detection work for multiple high priority species and providing assistance with aquatic plant questions and identification.  Aerial surveys will be conducted for Spartina spp. during both summer months for senescent cordgrasses and during winter months for Spartina densiflora (dense-flowered cordgrass).  Spartina alterniflora has successfully been spotted during previous aerial surveys and we anticipate the newly listed noxious weed, common reed (Phragmites australis) will be equally spotted during these surveys.   We will monitor known sites of S. alterniflora in Coos Bay, the Siuslaw River estuary and the Columbia River and for S. patens at the Port of Siuslaw site within the Siuslaw River estuary to check for regrowth.  Because correct identification is critical in early detection efforts, we will receive and identify unidentified aquatic plant samples from ODA, other agencies and/or private citizens.  We will also assist with identification and response to citizen reports of aquatic plant species on the Oregon Invasive Species Online Hotline. ",,,,,,,

The net acres this past treatment season (2012) were 10.4. Both weed species are being managed for eradication. This is a long term process and efforts must continue to eliminate the seed bank. It is important to continue to protect Oregon’s range, pasture, and overall watershed health from further invasion by these non-native plants.  This project will be a collaborative effort across boundary lines. Since weeds do not know boundaries all partners involved decided to form a collaborative team. The soil and water conservation districts from the three impacted counties along with federal partners will work together to continue to work toward complete eradication of woolly distaff. Douglas SWCD will continue to collaborate with ODA and the two impacted landowners to work toward complete eradication of Paterson’s curse. Partners involved will have pre season and post season briefings, as well as, join forces during the heart of control season in survey and eradication efforts. Douglas SWCD is the link between known infestations in Josephine, Curry and Douglas Counties and therefore will take administrative lead.  A contract crew will be hired by Douglas SWCD in June and sites will be worked for a minimum of three times for woolly distaff and Paterson’s curse. In addition, the SWCD will hire a seasonal employee to help in daily supervision of crews and will work with contract crew to GPS locations of current treatment sites.

In the East Fork of the Illinois River CEEN discovered Knotweed in the mouth of Althouse Creek. On the main channel of the Illinois River CEEN discovered many small outbreaks of Knotweed, some so small the rooting branch could be teased from the sand. The project was successful in that all Knotweed and Alyssum found during our surveys was treated, totaling 20 net acres of Knotweed treated and 1 net acre of Alyssum murale treated. The Alyssum was pulled when found, the Knotweed required revisits with a person from The Nature Conservancy who has license to spray. CEEN continues to monitor the treated sites.  Because the Illinois River runs through a complex matrix of landownership types including, state, Forest Service, BLM and private lands, CEEN is in a unique position to be able to cross these landownership types, and work with the many individuals and local groups in the Illinois Valley.  Though last year we were able to determine that the Illinois River population of Knotweed was originating on Althouse Creek, we were not able to locate the exact location of the originating Knotweed.  In 2013 CEEN will further search the Althouse Creek area, contacting landowners in the area and doing outreach and education, looking for the source of the Knotweed so it can be treated and stop the spread into the Illinois River system. In 2013 CEEN will also survey the East Fork and main stem of the Illinois River for additional outbreaks of these noxious weeds. This year the surveys will include additional acreage over the 1572 acres surveyed last year.  The East Fork will again be scouted for possible escapees from a known field of Alyssum that is near the California border.

In August 2012, CoosWA staff surveyed 115 gross acres of purple loosestrife (35 net acres) at 70 sites. While no infestations were observed in the Isthmus, Willanch, Kentuck, Larson, Palouse, North Slough and Heads-of-Tide sub-basins, there were 2 new sites on Catching Slough, one new site in Eastside, one new site in Barview and two new sites found in the Blossom Gulch sub-basin. Fortunately, plants at these 6 new sites were sparse enough to be either manually removed (Sites 65, 66 & 67) or chemically treated (Site 70). In summary, no plants were found at 22 sites (31.8%), 25 sites were under 0.125 acres (36.4%) and 22 sites were between 0.125 to over 5 acres (31.8%).

The Scappoose Bay Watershed Council (SBWC) and the Columbia Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) have been working cooperatively to conduct outreach and work with private landowners and public entities to treat knotweed species on their properties.  This ongoing effort has seen a drastic reduction of knotweed that is evident in photo documentation, feedback from landowners, and the amount of time and chemicals needed in subsequent treatments.  SBWC and the SWCD have consulted with ODA staff and have adopted effective treatment protocols that are proving effective for other management efforts.  After four years of constant herbicide pressure on knotweed in the Scappoose Creek system, many knotweed populations continue to persist but with small, mutated shoots and leaves.  In 2012, knotweed treatment was suspended for the year to encourage the plants to produce more vigorous shoots and leaves to better take up herbicides in a 2013 treatment.  This decision was made after consulting with ODA staff and conversations with other knotweed managers who have had success implementing this method.    The project proposes to treat knotweed species along 19 miles of creeks in the Scappoose Bay Watershed.  The majority of the treatment will take place along North Scappoose Creek, South Scappoose Creek, and Scappoose Creek.  Two sites of giant knotweed (Fallopia sachalinensis) occur along Milton Creek outside of St. Helens but no other knotweed populations have been identified along Milton Creek.

Chemical treatments with Telar and Escort with 2,4-d when appropriate will be applied on the ground.   Skeletonweed treatments will be done with Milestone @ 7 oz/acre.  A late fall chemical application of Tordon @ 1 quart/acre (BLM lands), Clopyralid @ 16 oz/acre (USFS) or Milestone @ 7 oz/acre (private) will be made at the first opportunity.  Other high priority weeds (listed at the outset of this application) will also be treated as the opportunity arises.    2) Inventory: Contractors and staff will survey for common bugloss and other high priority weeds while treating known bugloss sites.  In the past, new invaders such as annual bugloss have been detected during these surveys.  WCP will use known sites to prioritize skeletonweed inventory areas.    Skeletonweed is a challenging plant to see no matter the circumstances, but fall rains, grasshoppers and fires can all make spotting the plants very difficult.  Fall rains cause green up and the contrast between skeletonweed and background vegetation decreases.  Grasshoppers in high densities can “skin” the skeletonweed plants, causing them to look different.  Depending on intensity and fuel load, fires can either burn standing plants (making them invisible) or leave them conspicuously standing in the open.  These factors force managers to stay flexible on where, when and how surveys are conducted. Usually the best visibility is during the heat of summer or early fall.   Inventory results will be mapped using GPS units and computer mapping programs in concert with aerial photos (where possible), hand-marked USGS quad maps, and site notes.

In 2006, the Tualatin SWCD, Clean Water Services (CWS), and Tualatin River Watershed Council (Council) partnered to map and treat garlic mustard along a four-mile reach of Gales Creek using funds from the Oregon State Weed Board Grant Program. This effort stemmed from the Council's Lower Gales Creek Habitat Enhancement Plan (the Plan) that studied a four mile reach of Gales Creek (River Mile 10.99 to River Mile 6.76). The Plan identified in-stream and riparian projects that will improve habitat for the federally listed fish species.  One of the highest priorities is invasive plant removal coupled with re-vegetation of riparian corridors with native herbs, shrubs and trees. Garlic mustard was first identified along this four mile reach of Gales Creek in summer of 2006.  While Garlic Mustard is listed as a ""B"" weed by the ODA, it is listed as a weed of prime importance by the 4-County Cooperative Weed Management Area. It is critically important to identify and control isolated patches of garlic mustard in order to prevent its spread to adjacent watersheds including the coast, which has largely escaped the invasion but is highly vulnerable.     Since 2006, the entire stretch of Gales Creek has been surveyed, revealing garlic mustard beyond the original four-mile reach. Chemical treatment was done in 2010 and 2011 using funds from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Treatment was continued in 2012 using funds from the Oregon State Weed Board. Permit of Entry (POE) forms are collected from private landowners within the Gales Creek Watershed each year, allowing contractors to access private land for treatment.

In addition, yellow starthistle uses more water than native plants, thereby sequestering valuable water resources and changing rangeland stream and river dynamics. Increased erosion and diminished soil quality also are common on infested rangelands since invasive plants often cause alterations in runoff patterns, which may lead to exposed areas and further infestation. Union County landowners have been working closely with cooperating agencies, and university affiliates to gain the upper ground on this invasive species.  Eastern Oregon University has been working with landowners for over twenty years to aid in finding solutions to Union County’s growing yellow starthistle concerns.

Approximately 10 years ago perennial pepperweed began invading these meadows and with lack of education this species was allowed to run rapid through the water systems and across the valley.  The ZX Ranch recognized the issue in 2009 they contacted the Lake County CWMA and began progressively working towards containing the infestation.  During 2009-2010 Simplot took on aggressive approach of spraying 3,000 acres of perennial pepperweed.  During this time Simplot was not the only one trying to improve the watershed.  In 2009 the Lake County Watershed Council and US Forest Service began a large restoration project to restore the riparian area and to reconnect the floodplains.  When work began in the upper watershed the Lake County CWMA was contacted to address several noxious weed issues found within the restoration area.   The Lake County CWMA and partners quickly saw a large hole between the two project areas and decided to propose a watershed wide cooperative weed control project.

The Dusenbury road is an isolated road that was historically used as a logging road bypassing the main roads in Lakeview.  The road itself is owned by Collins Timber LLC; however, it is now only used by the landowners who own the adjacent property.   The project stretches across five different private landowners.  The goal is to make a seamless weed control effort and cooperate with all of the involved landowners.   Since this was an unfamiliar species to most of the landowners it took quite a bit of education and persistence to get the project started in 2012, however by the end of the year all of the landowners were happy to see good progress taking place in the watershed.    After surveying the spotted knapweed infestation the Lake County CWMA and ODA realized that due to the large amount of plants present that this infestation has been around for a while, but has stayed isolated to the Dusenbury road area.  The survey revealed that the infestations were present across most of the steep terrain of Rabbit Hill just east of Duesenbury road; it also revealed a few scattered spotted knapweed patches south of the project area, along with several large Scotch thistle sites.  During the 2012 field season a hired contractor sprayed 250 net acres of spotted knapweed with Scotch thistle mixed in across the project area, and several of the private landowners continued to spot spray small outlying infestations throughout the year.   Since 2012 was our first year working in the Dusenbury area we were unprepared for the steep brushy country we would be working in, due to this we will be adjusting our application budget in 2013 so that we can spend more time and get better coverage across the uplands.

Since the 2009 survey the Lake County CWMA, private landowners, along with all of the involved state and government agencies have been diligently battling these noxious weed infestations by chasing down all of the small outlying infestations to eradicate them and working together to contain the large infestations.   These past weed control efforts have been funded by OSWB, BLM, ODA, Oregon Department of State Lands, and the private landowners.    Over the past five years all of the partners have saw great improvements across the entire landscape.  The Lake County CWMA has hosted many landowner educations, which have encouraged the landowners to spray their noxious weeds.  The private landowners on the south end of the valley have done a fantastic job controlling their small outlying infestations.  Many of the landowners have been spraying over two hundred acres annually through cost-share programs and on their own.  The spraying has been done by 4-wheeler sprayers, pick-up sprayers, and helicopters.  ODA and BLM have made a lot of head way on the Warner Valley wetlands.  The landowners now feel they are ready to tackle their large problem infestation areas.  Over the past three years the Department of State Lands has sprayed 1,000 acres of the heavily infested Crump Lake areas using a helicopter.

Ludwigia was first discovered at Delta Ponds in 2007 and over subsequent growing seasons it rapidly increased, nearly taking over a shallow pond in the center of the site. In 2011 and 2012 the City of Eugene, using internal funding, hired contractors to manually pull Ludwigia growing in the water and to spot spray Ludwigia found along the shore and in mud flats. The goal was to reduce the outlying plants upstream and downstream of the area of worst infestation. Manual control included pulling plants along the shoreline by crews in waders and pulling hard-to-reach plants in deeper water using long handled cultivators and similar tools from flat bottom boats. In the pond with the severe infestation, crews also experimented with using machetes to cut out rectangles of vegetation which were pulled to shore. In all cases, workers were instructed to pull as much of the plant out as possible, including the roots. All plant material pulled out as part of these manual control efforts was piled on shore to dry out and decompose. Past herbicide control consisted of two rounds of careful spot spraying of plants growing on dry land along the banks using a mix of 2% glyphosate, 2% triclopyr, and the surfactant Agridex. The City’s efforts to date have been successful in keeping the Ludwigia from taking over areas both upstream and downstream of the worst infestation.

The last several years have been good with reducing net acres found and treated. A trend toward more scattered and much smaller discreet sites has been developing. Most sites recently found are single to 5 plants. Less than 100 net acres of Leafy spurge were treated with herbicide last season and we expect to be near that number this coming season. Of course winter precipitation will dictate that to some degree. Again we expect more isolated and scattered sites, which increases cost and difficulty.

There are several bio-control agents on site and these will continue to be monitored by ODA staff, BLM and Malheur County Weed Dept.. Bio-control agents have been placed at the lower elevations where the plant density seems more favorable.

Nearly 250 net acres were treated this past season. With some qualification it can honestly be stated that Rush skeletonweed in north Malheur County is in a static state. The project does not manage to treat all areas each season, the total number of treated acres over a three year cycle remains roughly static. That has not been the case on federal lands however and those total acres are increasing slowly over time. One troubling trend is the increased traffic from our neighbors in Idaho, particularly Ada County where CHJU is rampant. Some of the most rapidly increasing sites are areas that these folks frequent mainly to fish and hunt and ride ATV/Motorcycles. If you wish to know the full impact of CHJU and how dense it can become, there are many thousands of acres to look at in Payette and Washington counties across the Snake River. The most heavily affected areas in Malheur County are within the “VALE PROJECT” which removed large areas of sagebrush and attempted to replace with Siberian wheatgrasses. The Vale District BLM has made numerous attempts at reseeding these areas, generally after fire. As you may be aware, the viability of seeding projects is always sketchy in this area due to erratic precipitation patterns. Even in “good years” it is difficult to find robust establishment.

Most sites received two applications at different times with different chemicals each time and approximately 16 acres had three applications, for a total of 120 acres of herbicide treatment. The remaining 7 acres were treated by manual hand-pulling using hired crews, in-kind match and volunteers.   We are happy to report that our successes far outweighed any failures in the 2012 treatment efforts. Even the one area in which we fell short of expectations is a result of previous successes. We did not have nearly as many volunteer hand pulling days in 2012 as we hoped for. This was the result of there being a reduced number of plants at Valley of the Rogue State Park (VRSP) that were accessible for a volunteer effort. The plant population is starting to see a decline in some areas at VRSP as a result of the previous four years of treatment that has occurred. In other cases, the work we have accomplished previously is allowing us to accomplish our goals in a more efficient fashion.

In 2012 there were 16 active Gorse sites and only 2 are being managed for containment.  All other sites are being treated for eradication.  75 active Gorse sites since 1954 have been identified.  Currently Lincoln County has 16 known active sites; all others were in most cases, eradicated.  On two sites, Inn at Otter Crest (approx. 1 acre net active gorse) and SW Coast in Lincoln City (approx. 3 acres net active gorse), steep cliffs and unstable ground below hotels and homes, prevent eradication as Gorse may quite literally be the only plant holding the bank up. On these two sites total eradication is impractical and we manage for containment.

The Wheeler County Court does not want a weed district with regulatory authority. Therefore, there is currently no enforcement of invasive species control. This has been the political situation historically, and will be for the foreseeable future. This lack of enforcement combined with a demographic shift away from agriculture and towards recreational/retirement land use has led to a situation ripe for establishment of new invasive species.

The goal of this fund is to prevent the establishment of new invasive species on a subwatershed basis. This will be accomplished through creating and maintaining a subwatershed scale weed database, monitoring for new weed infestations, and utilizing EDRR management when new infestations are found.

Treatment for Gorse began in 2003, since the onset of this project net acres have declined by 55.22 net acres. This project proposal is to continue treatment in the current treatment areas and to monitor/treat inactive sites for newly sprouting plants. Funding for this project is critical in maintaining the high levels of control that has been achieved on these two invasive species. Keeping plants from producing seed is the key role in keeping this project successful.   Douglas SWCD's project coordinator took ODA's new Weed Specialist on a tour of the project area this past spring. Her overall impession was amazement in how much progress has been made. BLM is also impressed with the large decline in plant populations and hopes that this project will continue to be funded to ensure that the ground gained is not lost. Everyone involved in this project would love to continue seeing Oregon's native beauty not the nasty invasive weeds that were once so abundant. At the beginning of the project you could stand on a ridge top and look out at the valley below and only see Portuguese broom, today you can stand on the same ridge and look out to the valley  below and see conifers and other natives. Landowners are asked to pay for the cost of chemicals used on their properties, and grant funding is used for contract services and some personnel time. Landowners perform post treatment restoration efforts. Douglas SWCD actively assists landowners with choosing proper vegetation for their lands on sites that are left more barren after treatment. At several sites reseeding has kept these sites cleaner with minimal resprouting. Other locations throughout the project area have been able to recover naturally using the existing native seed bank and has been more than adequate to revegitate sites to prevent ",,,,,,,

After talking to the landowners in the valley, we decided the best approach for this treatment is to use aerial application and cover large tracts of infested lands. This method was chosen because the infestations take in very large areas, but they are scattered evenly throughout the area. The issue with attempting to treat these from the ground is the real possibility of missing infestations. The gross acres in the project area are 4740, with the net acres being 1130. Of the 1130 net acres, there are 540 net acres of pepperweed, 350 net acres of whitetop, and 240 net acres of scotch thistle. We plan to use Telar XP for the Pepperweed and Whitetop.

In the southern part of Curry County from Port Orford south to the California border, Gorse is very rare with mostly small patches that can be treated and contained. The Curry County Cooperative Weed Management Area Plan recognizes Gorse as a target weed of primary concern due to the potential spread of existing sites (Harris Beach) to other locations within Curry County.  The site at Harris Beach is the largest known site in the southern part of Curry County.    The purpose of the “Harris Beach Gorse & Restoration” project is to treat the target weed at Harris Beach State Park  which has relatively isolated, manageable patches of Gorse.  Located on the north end of Brookings, Harris Beach State Park is along the coast in Southern Curry County.  This 50 acre park has approximately 16 net acres of Gorse. The method of control will be with Garlon 3A herbicide during the late Spring and late Fall.  The restoration component will include planting grass seed, such as Calamagrostis nutkaensis (Pacific Reed Grass), as recommended by Sheri Laer of Oregon State Parks.    The primary objectives of this project are to:  (1) Control currently targeted Gorse plants   (2)  Establish grass in these areas to compete with Gorse  (3)  Educate the public and homeowners about Gorse  (4) Update and maintain a database inventory of Gorse via cooperation of landowners and Oregon State Parks (including ODA's Weedmapper)  ",,,,,,,

After preliminary surveys Lincoln SWCD estimates that there is about 0.5 - 1.5 net acres within the city limits of Yachats and the adjacent forest lands. This project entails a thorough survey of the affected area and treatment of any infestations found. Method of treatment will be primarily manual control due to the infestations being highly dispersed and relatively immature. On larger/older plants that are beyond control with manual measures, a cut-stump application consisting of a 30-50% mixture of the herbicide triclopyr (either Garlon 3A or Garlon 4 Ultra) will be used.  A cash contribution of $3104 for control of Daphne laureola from the Coast Range Stewardship Fund (USFS) will be used as match for this proposal. Volunteer help will also be enlisted for the removal of Daphne laureola, this will constitute an in-kind match of $720 which was calculated at a rate of $15 per volunteer hour.  The majority of funding from this proposal will go to on-the-ground control of 14 different Clematis sites. Funding from OSWB grant # 2012-252-38 helped Lincoln SWCD treat 9 of these sites in 2012 and some of the proposed funds will go to a second treatment of these previously treated sites. 11 of the 14 sites slated for treatment in 2013 are within a close proximity to travel corridors (e.g. highways, roads, or rivers) deeming them a high priority for treatment.   The 9 sites treated in 2012 were given a variety of treatments which included: foliar applications, cut-stump applications, and mechanical and manual control.  The method determined to be the most successful involves cutting the vines for the first year of treatment, essentially ""top killing"" the plant material in the canopy, and then following up with a foliar herbicide treatment the next year when there is more accessible ground cover foliage. 3 of the 9 sites treated in 2012 had already been manually treated by Lincoln SWCD.",,,,,,,

Fragments and seeds of several types of species can break-off, float downstream, and take root in the bottom sediments; and, plants can be transported by irrigation networks to ponds and block pump intakes. Dense canopies can alter aquatic ecosystems by displacing native aquatic plants, raising water temperatures by obstructing flow, and accelerating sedimentation rates.  Approximately 25 sites have been selected for survey in Josephine County, as well as sites in the Applegate Reservoir, which flows into Josephine County. Approximately 20 miles of shoreline will be surveyed by boat. The remaining shoreline locations will be walked or waded.  The survey will identify and note distribution of invasive aquatic weeds.

Work on Spurge Laurel was begun in 2008 when Landowner George Hibbs came into the YSWCD office and told us about a plant that he had been fighting for years and he could not kill. He asked us to help him and we proceeded to make some site visits, do some planning, and submit for funds to help him control the infestation.    We originally mapped the total project area at around 750 acres with a very dense infestation of about 100 acres in the center. Treatment was focused on those 100 acres. We found out quickly why George has had such a hard time with this plant. The plants that were first treated could be classified a “monoculture”. The application work was done by two trucks with 500 foot hose lines and it was very effective. ODA’s Glenn Miller helped with this work and we are grateful. In following years, the work has been done with back pack sprayers. Of course, as the plants have become more sparsely distributed on the landscape, the control efforts have gone down in effectiveness. Spurge Laurel is a plant with a waxy leaf. The ester formulation in Element 4 seems to be the only thing we can spray, on label that consistently does a good job at control. It is a plant that can only be sprayed from late February to mid April. We stop spraying in April because we don’t want to damage the neighboring vineyards at the time of bud break. Spraying that late into the spring is ineffective also because the smaller emerging plants are hard to see with all the other plants that are coming up at the time. Also, the poison oak makes working that late in the season very difficult. That leaves us with a very small window to  spray. There have been years when we got one spray day in between February 20th and April 4th. Last year, we started working with a larger crew of spot sprayers and that seem to work better. ",,,,,,,

Happy Valley has two main drainages that come off Riddle Mountain and Steens Mountain. The creeks that run down these drainages are Paul Creek and Riddle Creek, which meet and run into Happy Valley from the southeast. The other creek is Smyth Creek which runs into Happy Valley from the south west. This project goes up these drainages to the BLM managed boundary. Happy Valley is a self-contained valley; it does not drain out anywhere. The only way to make this project successful is to get every landowner in the valley onboard with the project. Dan Otley, a Harney County Weed Board member and a landowner in this valley, has brought every one of his neighbors together, which is the only reason we are pursuing this cost share grant.   After talking to the landowners in the valley, we decided the best approach for this treatment is to use aerial application and cover large tracts of infested lands. This method was chosen because the infestations take in very large areas, but they are scattered evenly throughout the area. The issue with attempting to treat these from the ground is the real possibility of missing infestations. The gross acres in the project area are 4740, with the net acres being 1130. Of the 1130 net acres, there are 540 net acres of pepperweed, 350 net acres of whitetop, and 240 net acres of scotch thistle. We plan to use Telar XP for the Pepperweed and Whitetop. Some of the pepperweed and whitetop is located on ditch banks, so we plan on using Garlon 3A because there is seasonal and perennial water in these ditches. For the scotch thistle we plan on using Milestone.  All of the scotch thistle in the meadows will be spot sprayed. We have one landowner, Roaring Springs, which has expansive patches of scotch thistle. We plan on treating this aerially due to the size of these patches. At the completion of this project our goal is 80% initial control.  ",,,,,,,

Working with landowners and land managers the CWMA has been able to decrease major populations of perennial pepperweed in the Quinn, Rome, Rockville and Jordan Valley areas, Russian knapweed in Dannerarea and the Lodge Ranch reduce Rush skeletonweed at Arock.  This was accomplished by private landowners and commercial applicator treatments.  Leafy spurge has been decreasing along Jordan Creek, but a new infestation was found and treated along the irrigation feeder ditch.  Yellow starthistle has been treated on BLM and private ground for several years with good results some years and poorer results others.  This has been due to short statured plants in tall grass and sporadic moisture patterns.  Over all, yellow starthistle has been kept out of Jordan Creek Canyon, but has reappeared in areas previously treated.  Landowners are treating more weeds on private land each year.  As time has gone on, the original landowners are no longer depending on the grant for treatment help and other landowners have joined the program.  An estimated 380 acres of noxious weeds will be treated with this grant with the majority of acres being perennial pepperweed and Russian knapweed.  Chemical treatments are the most effective method to deal with established perennial populations.  Prevention and education will be utilized to help decrease the spred of all noxious weeds in the CWMA.  In most cases, adequate desirable vegetation is present to fill in the void left by the eliminated plants.  The objectives of this project include: 1) Decrease the extent of noxious weed infestations, 2) Identify and treat additional sites as found, 3) Continue to map infestations, and 4) to increase awareness of the seriousness of noxious weed infestations; and to increase coordination across management boundaries within the CWMA.

The area burned affects over 20 landowners and 65,000 acres of private ground.  By the nature of an EDRR grant the number of acres of noxious weeds is unknown, but a concern.   By using early detection and rapid response, the impact of introduced noxious weeds can be decreased.  Weeds of concern include: Scotch thistle, hoary cress, Russian knapweed, Rush skeletonweed, perennial pepperweed and other A and B listed weeds.   Restoration at this point is not a component of this grant.  In some cases, the landowner will have done some seeding and in those cases we will check for noxious weeds in the seeding.  The objectives of this grant include: Early Detection and Rapid (Response) treatment of noxious weeds where hay was fed, straw was used and seed was spread. Survey fire lines for noxious weed infestations due to equipment movement. Determine extent of noxious weed infestation due to the fire. Work with landowners to identify unknown weeds they encounter. Decrease effect of weed invasions of black ground. This project dovetail with other project in the Jordan Valley CWMA.   EDRR is a portion of the Jordan Valley CWMA Strategic Plan and fits with the Malheur County plan as well.   The Vale BLM will be surveying and treating on Federal lands.  The Jordan Valley Weed Control Grant works on Rush skeletonweed, leafy spurge, Russian knapweed and perennial pepperweed along with yellow starthistle and other noxious weeds.

This study will include four sites representative of diverse climatic regimes: the Alsea River in the coastal forests of western Oregon, the middle fork of the Willamette River, Steamboat Creek at higher elevation in the western Cascades, and the Malheur River in the semi-arid, continental climate of eastern Oregon. At these sites, we will rigorously apply dendrochronology (tree-ring) techniques to: 1) Ensure all mussel growth increments are assigned the correct calendar year using the dendrochronology technique of crossdating. 2) Build high resolution, multi-decadal chronologies that capture variability on a range (inter-annual to decadal) of timescales. 3) Establish climate-growth relationships using available records of stream temperature (Middle Fork Willamette River and Steamboat Creek) and flow as well as regional measures of air temperature and precipitation (all sites). 4) Use mussel chronologies and climate-growth relationships to reconstruct thermal regimes over periods longer than those provided by instrumental records. Strengths of the chronologies and climate-growth relationships will be compared among these diverse regions to determine which climatic variables are captured by freshwater mussel growth.

Specific to the Sodom/Calapooia complex, we hypothesize that dam removal responses may include a) increase in access, use, and quality of habitat in historical Calapooia as side channel habitat by both native and introduced fish species, b) improvement in habitat of Sodom channel for native species, c) increased presence of native and introduced fish species upstream of Sodom dam and in the mainstem  Calapooia, but not in the historical Calapooia.

ODFW annually conducts spawning surveys on the upper reaches and in 2001 found over 50 redds in a two mile stretch. Connectivity to these upper reaches is important to juvenile survival because lower reaches dry up in late summer/fall periods of the year. This project proposes to build a concrete step-pool fishway on the west side of the channel in the natural thalweg of the stream, incorporating it into the existing structure and extending it 30’ downstream. ODFW & NOAA have been on site and have provided suggestions and input to the engineer firm responsible for the design. ODFW and the CTWS are the partners on this project. ",,,,,,,

Two irrigation diversions are currently blocking adult and juvenile passage very low in the stream system, prohibiting migration to headwater areas where cool water is essential to their survival. After initial consultation and site visits with the engineering firm hired to do this project, NOAA and ODFW, it was decided the best solution was to build a ramp/pool project at the RM five diversion; and add an additional compartment to the existing but degraded and out of compliance fish ladder at RM seven.

The proposal involves removal of fill material and replacing the culverts with a railcar bridge. The current configuration is a partial barrier to Chinook salmon and steelhead at low- to intermediate flow conditions. At high flows, the culverts are believed to create a velocity barrier to fish seeking off-channel refugia. The installation of a channel-spanning bridge will allow fish passage and a fully functional off-channel habitat area at all flows.

It would provide 13 days of “Watershed Camp” for approximately 50 students, broken into three sessions, geared for introductory campers (4 days), intermediate campers (4 days) and advanced watershed exploration campers (5 days). The Camps will be offered to students from grades 4 through 12. Each session will have a $60 participation fee but scholarships will be available for participants who otherwise would not be able to participate. The Camp workshops will focus on providing the campers with an overview of the need for watershed restoration projects as well as practical, hands-on experience with those types of projects. Campers will study post-implementation restoration sites and work on active restoration project sites. Partners in the project include USFS-Mapleton District, private Foundations, local businesses, camper families, the Siuslaw SWCD and the Siuslaw Watershed Council.

It is prudent for these groups to collaborate more closely in the field. OACD and NOWC can help further this initiative. Both organizations recognize the complementary nature of their respective missions and seek to develop a partnership that will increase their capacity to collectively support conservation and restoration in Oregon. OWED funds will be used to develop and build this partnership, allowing both organizations to offer joint programming, find operational efficiencies in shared resources, and develop partnership opportunities that benefit councils and districts, as well as their supporting agencies and partners.

This ecological change has altered the pattern of livestock and wildlife grazing.  This has resulted in more grazing pressure on the riparian area grasses and woody vegetation and reduced sage grouse habitat on the property.  Junipers effectively use available moisture and also use the early spring water before other plants begin to grow. This competition leads to fewer plants, less soil cover, lower water infiltration rates and more opportunity for overland flow and soil erosion.  Implementation will include the mechanical thinning of approximately 145 acres of juniper in conjunction with a 200 acre federal sage grouse landowner incentive program.  This project will increase the water available for stream flow, plant species, wildlife and fisheries and increase the amount of forage.
