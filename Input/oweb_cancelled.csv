These non-native plants contribute to the loss of native aquatic species by removing the necessary nutrients from the water column that native fish and other native organisms need to survive.  These invasive plants severely impact water quality by trapping sediments and reducing dissolved oxygen to levels dangerous for native fish species.  They also provide cover and rearing habitat for non-native fish such as bass and perch that prey on native Coho and cutthroat trout fry.  Use of a bottom barrier material is more suitable than use of copper sulfates which are dangerous to fish and can have a severe impact on water quality.  Road fabric will be installed over the 100 x 300 yd. area adjacent to Tenmile Lakes Coos County Park during August when lake levels low.  The fabric will be anchored in place with sandbags.

Changes in land management, such as fire suppression and reduced timber harvests, have led to conifer encroachment to aspen stands. This encroachment, coupled with heavy grazing by wild and domestic ungulates, has led to declining aspen communities across the landscape. This proposal will thin competing shrubs and conifers; under-burn select sites and buck and pole fence to protect eleven aspen stands and one fen wetland site; and construct two off-channel water developments for wildlife and livestock.  Several of the sites are directly adjacent to streams that provide critical spawning habitat for ESA listed summer steelhead. The remaining sites are located in meadow systems at the headwaters of critical habitat streams. The fen wetland site provides year-round cool water inputs to Long Creek, as well as habitat for the Columbia spotted frog and two rare and imperiled moss species: Meesia uliginosa and Helodium blandowii. Project partners include the Malheur National Forest Service, North Fork John Day Watershed Council and the allotment permittee.

It is not fenced along the river allowing livestock access to the stream where they tend to congregate causing overgrazing and bank erosion.  The upper portion of the pasture is not being utilized and over time invasive species may take over the native vegetation.  This project will install a fence about ¼ mile up the hill to keep the cattle out of about 2 miles of river.  An alternative watering source will be developed by tapping into an existing spring fed water system and piping water to a new trough in the pasture.

The highway divides the landowner’s 142 acre property.  This area is not currently used for cattle grazing due to the lack of a water source.   The new trough will allow the landowner to implement a grazing plan letting the west side pasture rest and the existing grass to rehabilitate.  A herd of elk routinely use the west side pond and seasonal creek as a place to drink and bed down.  Trees and shrubs will be planted in blocks around the property to increase habitat for wildlife."
