Once a vital component to the working mill, the waterway is still an important part of the mill property and of Salem's history. During the past few years, significant erosion has occurred on the banks of the mill site. The applicant proposes to construct 200 feet of rock ledges to provide support for the existing bank and to create pools in the center of the stream to allow for natural water flow away from the banks. OWEB funds will be used for contracted services."

The project is focused on the strategic dissemination of an educational film through a series of local screening and discussion events, widespread classroom use, and public television broadcasts. The film will provide viewers with a perspective of the entire Willamette basin as an ecosystem, a working landscape, and as fertile ground for restorative efforts that are reviving its ability to provide clean water, and support healthy native communities of aquatic and riparian species. Partners include Meyer Memorial Trust, BLM, USDA Forest Service, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and numerous smaller foundations. OWEB funds will be used to support postproduction."

OWEB funds will provide for site-specific restoration planning for 30 stream miles of within the North Clackamas Urban Watershed. The plan will identify limiting factors for salmonid production, invasive riparian plants, barriers to passage, and opportunities for wetland enhancement and instream wood placement. Aerial photographs and LiDAR will be evaluated to assess potential for floodplain reconnection and rearing habitat development. All identified restoration opportunities will be ranked in order of cost and biological importance. The final report will include all habitat data; landowner willingness information; project types and locations, including cost estimates and methods for invasives removal and native plant installation, photo-points, and a geodatabase. Partners include Clackamas Water Environment Services, Clackamas SCWCD, North Clackamas Park and Recreation District, Friends of North Clackamas Park, and the Oak Lodge Sanitary District.

USACE levees installed in the early 1940’s completely enclosed the southern half Sauvie Island, which restricted fish access and flows that prevented the lake from silting in.  Upstream dam flow regulation on the Columbia River further decreases flows and disconnects the lake from the rivers that formed it.  Proposed project is based on an action plan and alternatives analysis, and will re-open Dairy Creek and inlet into Sturgeon Lake that was functioning until the 1996 flood.  This two-phased project will replace two undersized culverts and implement measures to prevent material accumulation at the creek’s mouth.  OWEB funds are requested for contracted services and grant administration.  Project partners include USACE, BPA, Multnomah County, and West Multnomah SWCD."
