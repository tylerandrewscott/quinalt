We focus on controlling patches in the upper basins of the watershed since they act as ""source"" populations for future infestations. We also address infestations within the Siuslaw Estuary, since tidal fluctuations can transport rhizomes both upstream and down, potentially magnifying dispersion. Our primary method of control is foliar application of herbicide. When site specific conditions require alternative means, we perform stem injection, and use “heavy duty road fabric” to cover smaller scale patches for landowners who are anti-herbicide. ",,,,,,,,,,

If garlic mustard is not controlled in this area, it could quickly spread throughout much more of the Tualatin Basin. Giant hogweed, a “T” Designated weed, has also been identified in the Fanno Creek Watershed.

This 35,000 acre watershed provides important habitat for spring Chinook, rainbow trout, winter steel head, cutthroat trout, and lamprey. Riparian forests have been lost as land has been converted to other uses, including agriculture, pasture, and rural residential development. The remaining riparian buffers are minimal in extant and lack native plant species diversity, and thus are not providing adequate bank stabilization, shade, and large wood and organic material inputs to  the creek. Non-native species, including Armenian and European blackberry and reed canarygrass have become dominant in the understory and are outcompeting native species. Invasive knotweed populations that were controlled 7 years ago are beginning to expand again. Lost Creek and its tributaries regularly exceed state benchmarks for water temperature and dissolved oxygen. These factors result in a reduction in the diversity and value of habitats available for sensitive native aquatic and terrestrial species, and negatively impact other ecosystem services provided by riparian  buffers.

This project also addresses bank stability and flow captured in the slough for a range of various events.  The conceptual design uses bioengineering techniques to supplement existing bank stabilization measures and geomorphic principles to address flood-flow capture and avulsion abatement into McMullen Slough.    By increasing the density and diversity of the riparian plant community, the flow will slow and fine sediment collected to further improve the potential habitat for bull trout and other aquatic resources.   Grantee will establish willow clump plantings for three years following project completion.  Survival will include periodic watering and treatment – mechanical or chemical – of weeds by the willow clumps.  Since the project site is being planted with willow clumps and not bare-root species, the clumps should be planted in water and as such be able to establish more quickly than bare root species.  In year 1 following project implementation, Grantee will perform 2 weed entries.  Also, 2 weed entries would be planned for years 2 and 3. Watering should occur periodically.  Grantee will inspect the site at least four times annually for three years. The landowner will regularly monitor the site for damage from storms, predation and weeds and need for additional watering.   ",,,,,,,,,,

Those limiting factors along this 7,000’ reach of Mountain Creek, known as the bull pasture, have been exacerbated by historic grazing.

Historically Milton Creek was one of the most productive salmonid watersheds in Scappoose Bay; however, splash damming in the early 1900’s severely degraded the habitat.  Rapid bio-assessment surveys conducted by ODFW in 2009 found little wood within Milton Creek. A 2012 limiting factors analysis identified deficiency in summer rearing habitat as being the greatest impediment to smolt production in the Scappoose Basin largely due to lack of instream large wood.  This analysis identified the proposed project reach as an anchor habitat for coho smolt production and lack of large wood as a major limiting factor with only 0.5 key pieces per 100 meters.  Installation of large wood has high potential for restoring a complex stream system with braids and backwater habitat that would significantly contribute to juvenile salmonid survival.

Proposed monitoring will extend existing project for 6 months of sample collection for ambient water quality conditions and 12 months TSS lab analysis to complete the 24-months.  Final data will guide local municipalities implementing TMDL plans and local organizations will use information for public outreach and project prioritization.  Project involves a partnership of 5 municipalities, 2 state agencies, 3 watershed councils, and multiple landowners.

Crystal Springs also supports an at-risk native freshwater mussel (Anodonta).  Mussels can benefit from restoration, and healthy populations may effectively compete against invasive Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) that are abundant in Crystal Springs.  Dewatering and in-channel work involved in restoration is lethal to mussels, but most groups are unaware of mussels and/or lack expertise for salvage operations.  To assess impacts of habitat restoration on stream biota, The Xerces Society will work with Crystal Springs Partnership members and volunteers to assess changes in aquatic macro-invertebrates at restoration sites in Crystal Springs Creek; rescue and relocate native mussels from restoration sites; and assess survivorship and re-colonization of relocated mussels and changes in invasive Asian clam populations following restoration.

Trends in development in the McKenzie Watershed over the last 15-20 years has led to creation of smaller lot sizes (currently 37% of lots outside of urban growth boundaries are less than 1 acre) and hundreds of structures being built in riparian areas and floodways. Development in these sensitive areas causes a loss of riparian vegetation, increased use of revetment to protect vulnerable structures, increased chemical use, loss of floodplain function, and higher density of septic systems adjacent to water bodies.   Eugene Water and Electric Board (EWEB) has spent the last three years working with partners and landowners to design and implement a non-regulatory approach that compensates landowners to protect healthy riparian forests while encouraging restoration of degraded areas. The Voluntary Incentives Program will focus on approximately 8,200 acres of riparian forestlands (over 2,700 taxlots). Under this grant, EWEB and its partners will implement a VIP pilot project to test drive this concept with 16 landowners before full implementation in 2015.

One site incorporates a reach where channel reconfiguration actions and log placement occurred. The rest of the sites are located throughout the Upper Middle Fork John Day River in areas that restoration was planned to occur in the future or in areas that has existing historical information to provide additional background data. Monitoring will include the collection of stream habitat, riparian vegetation data, and macroinvertebrates. This project serves to evaluate the effectiveness of active and passive habitat restoration practices in the Middle Fork John Day River at a broad scale. The PIBO monitoring sites are being utilized to evaluate the watershed study area’s overall habitat status and trends.
