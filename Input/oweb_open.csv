The project area is characterized by large ranches surrounded by public lands. Perennial pepperweed remains a problem in meadow hay fields and some upland areas. This most concentrated sources are in quasi riparian zones. Perennial pepperweed populations have been stabilized at a manageable level over a good portion of the project area. The early intervention efforts have been very successful in the production hay meadow areas. The focus has shifted to sections of the North and South Forks of the Malheur River.  These remoter river sections are difficult to access with no real road nearby. Helicopter treatments have been used in the past and are part of the plan for this proposal. The group feels that these sections should probably be a priority.",,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this project is to assist local landowner in controlling perennial pepperweed in the native meadows and to contain an emerging russian knapweed infestation.  In 2015 Lake County CWMA will apply herbicide and biological control agents to approximately 2,000 acres, with the cooperation of landowners.  With many of the large patches of perennial pepperweed reducing in size and density, the project will now focus on areas that are difficult to access, and treating lower density infestations.  Again this year, landowners will have the option of aerial   application, coordinated by the Lake County CWMA.  There were well over 1,500 acres treated last year aerially, another 1000 in ground application. The Lake County CWMA expects the same amount of acreage in 2015. Irrigation canals will be a focus, continuing the treatment strategy from 2014. Landowners will treat areas with scattered plants with ground equipment throughout the treatment season. Alongside the treatment of perennial pepperweed, there are several areas of russian knapweed that have crept up in the past few years. Through an aggressive integrated weed management plan, the Lake County CWMA believes the russian knapweed can be contained.  Areas near the known russian knapweed infestations are known as sage grouse core habitat.   ",,,,,,,,,,

The Lake County CWMA is proposing to control 250 acres of perennial pepperweed, and an additional 20 acres of russian knapweed, 20 acres hoary cress, 25 acres of musk thistle, and 5 acres of spotted knapweed.  This will be done on a cost share baisis to help support the work that is currently being done by local landowners.

A quite expansive area, the basin is 12 miles across and 47 miles long, with the southern portion stretching into Modoc County California.  In the past several years, dyers woad has been slowly moving north from California along Highway 395, and has been mostly confined to the east side of the Goose Lake Basin.  This project is part of a concerted effort to stop the spread of dyers woad in Lake County, through manual control and herbicide application.  Working with the Bureau of Land Management, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, US Forest Service, Lake County, Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District, as well as many private land owners, this species has been identified as one that poses a great threat, yet one that can still be stopped in the early stages of infestation. In 2014 an expansive survey took place in the Goose Lake Basin which identified areas of infestation, as well as areas that have not yet been affected.   Dyer’s woad produces large amounts of seed and can be very had to control once established.  The timing for treatment is narrow, therefore, the Lake County CWMA plans on advertising and working with landowners prior to the treatment window, in the hope to raise awareness of the threat this weed poses, with the goal of stopping the further spread of this species.

Scotch thistle, pheasant eye, canadian thistle, and a small infestaion of dyer's woad will also be targeted witht this proposal.

Most sites along the Rogue River have been treated continuously since 2011, and those at Valley of the Rogue State Park since 2010. This highly invasive weed produces large seed crops which are spread by animals and water, and can survive in soil for over 5 years before germinating. For this effort to succeed, known sites must be revisited annually, and undiscovered pockets looked for.    Garlic mustard is an extremely invasive plant and it is known to spread quickly unless acted upon immediately after detection. If left untreated garlic mustard can create a complete monoculture in riparian areas and some upland areas, displacing native plants. Given the recent discovery of garlic mustard in our region and the fact that it is currently occuring in relatively small patches in the Rogue Basin, we believe that eradication is possible, but not without with a focused collaborative treatment program. Through herbicide application and hand-pulling, we will treat garlic mustard at all known Rogue Basin sites, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero new plant germination. As these populations are reduced through repeated treatments, each following treatment gets easier  ",,,,,,,,,,

We focus on controlling patches in the upper portions of key sub-basins since they act as ""source"" populations for future infestations downstream. We also address infestations within the Siuslaw Estuary, since tidal fluctuations can transport rhizomes both upstream and down, potentially magnifying dispersion. Our primary method of control is foliar application of aquatically approved herbicide. When site specific conditions require alternative means, our options include stem injection, or the use of “heavy duty road fabric” to cover smaller scale patches for landowners who are anti-herbicide.

OWEB initiated the Willamette Basin Ecosystem Services Project to test the ability to measure and track restoration outcomes—in the form of improvements to ecosystem processes and function—through time by applying ecosystem services metrics, and explore the potential for private funding for restoration to complement awards made by OWEB and other public entities.     TFT proposes a 10.88 acre riparian project on the mainstem of the lower Calapooia River as the demonstration project.  The Calapooia River has spawning habitat and juvenile rearing for endangered spring Chinook and winter steelhead.  Limiting factors for these fish populations include water quality issues (temperature, suspended sediment, nitrogen phosphorus, pesticides and bacteria) and lack of large wood. TFT seeks to control invasive weeds at the site and plant to a mix of shrubs and trees. . TFT will provide ecosystem service quantification estimates in terms of solar radiation reduction (kcal/day) using Oregon Department of Environmental Quality’s Shade-a-lator model.  Monitoring data collection at reference site and the planting site will be a joint effort.

Mountain Creek is listed in the Mid-C Recovery Plan as high priority watershed for steelhead spawning and rearing. In the 1950s, due to flooding of the ranch headquarters, Mountain Creek was forced into a by-pass channel that routed all flows along the north side of the meadow. The bypass channel offers little to no fish habitat. The landowner has agreed to allow for the return of Mountain Creek to the historic meadow channel as long as design considerations are made so ranch infrastructures will be protected from flooding. This requires the bypass channel be used as a “safety valve” to carry excess flows with a structure installed to regulate such flows during flood events. This final phase will involve active in-stream habitat restoration of the remaining 0.25 mile of historic channel incorporating bio-engineering, large wood placement and bank pull-backs; the installation of a control structure on a neighbor’s upstream property, before the beginning of the bypass channel. Working with this neighboring landowner resulted in an agreement to place the control structure on his land, and do additional restoration on his property by installing a bridge to replace a water gap so livestock and ranch vehicles have access to the back pasture without driving through Mountain Creek; enroll a final segment of Mountain Creek on his property into CREP; and build an alternative off-channel water source for his livestock.

Over three and a half miles of Rattlesnake Creek is identified by ODFW as steelhead habitat. The headwater basin is choked with juniper that directly impacts the natural hydrograph, both in groundwater sources and the interception of limited precipitation. Also, as juniper communities become denser, erosion and sediment movement becomes a problem as grass and shrubs in the landscape die-off and there is nothing to hold the soil during rain events. By strategically removing juniper in this headwater site, increased stream flow would improve over six additional miles of potential spawning and rearing habitat for Redband and ESA summer steelhead. Using a tracked feller-buncher, approximately 276 acres of encroaching juniper would be pulled and piled.

The project will address degraded wet meadow and spring habitat in order to re-establish flow and improve habitat. On the property, abundant springs and their associated wet-meadow habitats have been unprotected and degraded by decades of intensive grazing and logging. Where flow once contributed to Desolation Creek, several springs are trampled to the extent that water is pooling in hoof-prints rather than running toward the waterway. Springs and outflow channels have been stripped of protective vegetation causing channel incision and riparian degradation. Associated aspen stands are in decline and over-dense forests are encroaching on these wet-meadow ecosystems. This proposal includes installing 8,448 feet of fencing around wet meadows, developing five springs with off-site water for livestock, thinning six acres of encroaching forest thickets and protecting two stands of aspen.

Cropland can be vulnerable to sheet and rill erosion during extreme weather events such as rain on snow or flashy rain storms. This erosion causes excessive sediment transport into natural draws and swales resulting in degraded water quality as it reaches perennial streams. To resolve this issue, this project would install terraces and water and sediment control basins (WASCBs) on cropland slopes to catch and slow down overland flows, dropping out sediment before it reaches live water. Project components include building 11,970 feet of terrace and 15 cropland WASCBS. Partners on this project include Sherman Co Area Watershed Council, Sherman SWCD, NRCS and the landowner.

These creeks provide core spawning and rearing habitat for Bull Trout, Steelhead and Chinook salmon. However, the habitat which supports these species has been detrimentally altered due to historic logging, grazing, mining, beaver trapping, road construction and homesteads. The six meadows identified as project sites currently have gullies that drain erosive overland flow, rather than allowing it to soak into the ground. The proposed streams are over-stocked with encroaching conifers and have issues with floodplain connectivity and channel simplification evident by reduced large wood recruitment and low diversity in riparian vegetation. The proposed treatment will drop or tip select trees into the riparian zone, opening up the canopy for riparian hardwoods to re-establish and the large wood adding roughness to both channel and floodplain; and thin portions of conifer encroachment into meadows and place coarse, woody debris in eroding gullies to catch sediment and hold-back overland flows.

After the completion of an extensive assessment and prioritization of fish passage barriers on the lower twelve miles of Cottonwood Creek, Monument SWCD and partners have begun to correct those at the top of the list. Four sites were identified as top priorities – three have been completed or are in the process of being corrected - this proposal would correct the fourth and final of the highest priority sites. This project would consolidate two irrigation push-up dams that pose a barrier for juvenile steelhead and Chinook attempting to seek refuge in the upper Cottonwood Creek basin from the warmer waters of the North Fork John Day River. One of these diversions currently supplies water to an unscreened open irrigation ditch that has the high potential to strand fish in the field. Additionally, the other diversion conveyance is over 1,000’ of leaky above-ground mainline which loses a significant amount of water during transport to the field.   The project proposes to combine the two points of diversions into one fish-friendly rock weir-style diversion structure so the two push-up dams can be abandoned. ODFW will install a fish screen at the new diversion site that will exclude fish from both irrigation systems. The leaking, above-ground mainline will be replaced with 1,200’ of buried PVC pipe.
