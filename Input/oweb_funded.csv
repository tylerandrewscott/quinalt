The original application requested $750,000 to fund approximately 60% of the cost of permanent acquisition from Deming Creek Ranch (Ranch) of rights to 1601.7 acre-feet of water, or up to 13.35 cfs early-season and 6.675 cfs late-season flow, for transfer to an in-stream water right.  The instream rights will be held in trust by the State of Oregon and managed by the Oregon Water Resources Department (WRD).      The increased instream flows proposed in this project will benefit a 6.9 mile primary reach in Deming Creek and a 2.5 mile secondary reach in the South Fork of the Sprague River (SFS).  The primary reach is designated as critical habitat for threatened bull trout and provides important habitat for other species such as redband trout.  The secondary reach in the SFS provides habitat for Lost River and short-nosed suckers."

This sub-watershed is about six miles above Prineville Reservoir in Crook County. The project area has been impacted by historical overgrazing and includes a large reservoir and four downstream diversions, all of which are at least seasonal barriers to fish passage. There are native redband trout actively using Horse Heaven creek for spawning. There has been active management by the landowner in conjunction with the Crooked River Watershed Council and other partners of juniper and historical grazing issues to help restore native species in upland habitats and restore watershed function on this 32,000 acre sub-watershed, of which, 18,600 is owned by a single landowner. Much of the area has been fenced for improved livestock management. Some of this work was funded through a previous OWEB grant and the landowner has also born significant costs related to restoration activates. This project would install fish screens and provide passage at two active diversions, remove two diversions which are passage barriers and are no longer used. Partners in this project include the landowner and USFWS Partners Program. [Previously proposed instream work has been removed to reflect a reduced budget]. "
