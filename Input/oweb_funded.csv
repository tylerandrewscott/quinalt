The combination of invasive species encroachment in the riparian area, loss of native vegetation, juniper/ponderosa pine encroachment into historic grasslands, past land use practices, and fire suppression has created a decline in quality upland habitat and reduced water quantity and quality in the headwaters of the Bridge Creek basin. This project seeks funds to remove 400 acres of juniper, pre-commercial thin 55 acres of Ponderosa pine, and reseed 180 acres mechanically disturbed during juniper removal process.  This is just one part of a landscape scale treatment that will result in over 3,585 acres of juniper removed, 375 acres of forest stand improvements, 10 miles of Bridge Creek and 268 acres of riparian zone enrolled in FSAâ€™s Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and a follow-up prescribed burn schedule to keep juniper from re-establishing. Partners on this project include two landowners, Wheeler SWCD, NRCS and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs."215-6053,11762,6,0,Monitoring,Upper South Fork John Day WC,Watershed Council,John Day River Sub-Yearling Spring Chinook Salmon Monitoring to Enhance Population Productivity,Sue Greer,4/28/15,,,Grant,159541,159541,0,0,159541,,,N,John Day,Monitoring,Funded,0,0,"Juvenile Spring Chinook salmon in the Upper Mainstem John Day River encounter density dependent limitations on rearing space. Density dependence restricts production of yearling fish migrants, hence limits adult abundance. Little is known about the abundance, distribution and physiology of downstream rearing juvenile Chinook in the John Day River basin. Monitoring this life history will help focus on restoration projects that benefit juvenile rearing habitat. The monitoring sites are located in both the lower South Fork John Day River and mainstem John Day River in Grant County. Partners include the Upper South Fork of the John Day Watershed Council, Oregon State University and ODFW.
