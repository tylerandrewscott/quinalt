Riparian conditions exhibit legacy effects from mostly open range livestock management, such as lack of riparian vegetation and eroded streambanks. A 2008 Limiting Factors Analysis (LFA) describes the mainstem of Little Rock Creek and its tributaries as core juvenile coho summer rearing habitat and pinpoints this agricultural property as having a major impact on juvenile rearing potential citing excessive summer temperatures and poor riparian condition. The 2008, LFA determined that this property is significant enough in size to not only be a severe detriment to summer rearing but could also be a source of measurable recovery in summer temperature profiles, if conservation practices that exclude livestock and establish riparian vegetation were in place. The current landowner has agreed to conservation measures including livestock exclusion with an average 26 ft. and 21 ft. fence set back on each stream side of Little Rock Creek and Brush Creek, respectively, three acres of riparian planting using native shrubs and trees, off-stream livestock water, and heavy use protection in sensitive areas. Lincoln SWCD proposes to use OWEB, DEQ 319, and ODA funds, along with landowner in-kind contributions to implement these conservation measures and follow-up with three years of plant establishment. These measures will help to restore riparian function and improve water quality in these sections of the creeks benefiting aquatic species like coho salmon.     Project Partners include the project landowner, DEQ, NRCS, and the Northwest Oregon Restoration Partnership. OWEB funds would be used for project management, contracted services, travel, supplies and materials, permit fee, plant establishment and grant administration.   "

In conjunction with the planned timber sale, there is an opportunity for wood to be harvested and placed instream to provide improved habitat conditions for coho, Chinook, steelhead and cutthroat. ODFW has identified Ben Smith Creek as a highly productive coho stream with significant potential for supporting even higher densities if habitat conditions were improved. ODF, ODFW and the Tillamook Bay Watershed Council have selected three reaches to receive large wood placements to address the following limiting factors: reduced boundary roughness; altered flow, hydraulic and sediment regime; insufficient pool frequency; lack of nutrient sources; lack of food web support; lack of aquatic habitat complexity and infrequent floodplain connectivity. Large wood structures consisting of complexes of whole trees, approximately 40 - 50 feet in length and greater than 20 inches in diameter will be harvested from within the watershed and placed using ground-based heavy equipment. Access for placement of these logs will be via existing logging roads. Sixty-five trees will be put into 1.1 miles of Ben Smith Creek. Trees will be placed with branches and trunks keyed into existing riparian vegetation where possible.     Project partners include ODF and ODFW.

The dairy barn foundation and concrete milking floor are still present. Crowley Creek was channelized on the eastern edge of the meadow where it remains to this day. The solution is to restore hydrologic processes returning Crowley Creek flood flows to the meadow by removing dairy infrastructure and planting native vegetation. Juvenile salmon and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat will improve with additional tree planting for future shade and large wood. Elk forage and beaver habitat will be improved with plantings to speed wetland and meadow recovery. The upland plant community would be restored with noxious weed treatment and seeding wild flowers for Silverspot Butterfly nectar sources. Recreation is now a dominate use with Knight Park a gathering place for hikers and paddlers. The Nature Conservancy trail leaving Knight Park follows the western meadow boundary providing views of the freshwater wetlands within McKee Meadow.

Jetty Creek has 1.8 miles of high quality salmon spawning and rearing habitat; however fish passage is severely limited by the presence of a low head dam near the stream’s confluence with Nehalem Bay. This diversion creates the necessary water surface elevation to support the City’s drinking water withdrawal but also limits fish passage and affects streambed depositional processes. This project proposes to address these issues by installing a fish bypass channel to effectively take the City’s diversion and impoundment off-channel. The City’s point of diversion will be moved upstream and a new fish screen and meter will be installed.    Project partners include: City of Rockaway Beach, ODFW, OWRD, and NOAA Fisheries. OWEB funds will be used for: project management and construction including the new bypass channel, installing the new fish screen, installing streambed simulation rock, engineering oversight during construction, and fiscal management.

Connectivity impacts can include altered freshwater and tidal flow, more extreme flooding, altered salinity levels, changes in fish passage, and altered sediment dynamics. All anadromous fish are potentially affected by these changes in estuary function. To better understand highway impacts, The Nature Conservancy is proposing to conduct the following tasks (1) synthesize existing data, science and studies about Highway 101 and other state highways’ hydrologic connectivity impacts on Oregon estuaries, (2) identify key estuaries where highways’ impacts are the greatest, and (3) engage with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to identify co-benefit projects.

In 2003 the Siuslaw National Forest acquired significant portions of these creeks with the goal of restoring watershed function. These creeks were straightened and diked and large wood removed from the channels. The creeks subsequently downcut and channel complexity and function was severely reduced, decreasing habitat quality for coho and other native species. Riparian vegetation was transformed to non-native pasture grasses. The first two phases of restoration was partially funded by OWEB and included valley regrading, channel reconstruction, wood placement and native plant restoration. Phase III will involve re-grading and planting 41 acres of mixed and upland habitat with 61,000 native plants and 370 pounds of seed, re-constructing 1.9 miles of channel, filling 600 feet of old Fivemile Creek, placing 500 plantation trees in the re-constructed channel/floodplain and installing a new crossing to improve fish passage at Harry Creek.

As a result, it adversely affects aquatic organism passage (including blocking or impeding passage of adult and juvenile salmonids to approximately 0.7 miles of upstream habitats) and stream processes (including transport of stream bed material and organic matter). In addition, the culvert requires an inordinate level of inspection and maintenance to avoid plugging and breaching. Thus, it poses a serious risk to human health and safety as well as to downstream water and habitat quality and the survival of aquatic organisms.    Sixty (60) percent designs and cost estimates for a replacement structure at this location were completed in early 2015. The proposed project will finalize designs and specifications, remove the existing culvert and construct a 32-foot long concrete bridge. To assure long-term passage and functionality the project will construct approximately 100 feet of stream simulation channel. A temporary vehicle bypass structure will provide continuous access to residences and businesses up road of the crossing.

It was identified in an OWEB-funded Limiting Factors Analysis (LFA) as temperature and gravel limited. To address these issues, riparian planting, livestock exclusion fencing, culvert replacements and instream large woody debris placements have been implemented on a suite of eight cooperating small private landowners within the sub-basin. The LFA classified the lower main stem as highly incised, approximately 12 ft., and limited by truncated linkage to historical off channel rearing habitats. Both the USFWS and the MidCoast Watersheds Council have been instrumental in the development of salmonid accessible off channel wetland habitat in partnerships on the Parker property as part of this larger basin scale effort. In recent years the confluence of the wetland complex to Bummer Creek has become delinked as off channel refugia by a 5 ft vertical head-cut. LiDAR analysis has revealed the presence of 1.5 miles of diked and inaccessible oxbow habitat. The applicant proposes to extend riparian fencing and planting downstream on Bummer Creek to the next 2 adjacent private land parcels (140 acres combined), reconfigure the outlet of the wetland outlet to exit through its historical channel and develop additional wetland habitats to store and retain winter runoff to address the summer temperature limitation. This is a private landowner partnership with in kind match contributed from EQUIP and CREP. OWEB funds will support the creation of approximately 1500 ft of fence to exclude livestock on the Jackson property putting 7.7 acres of land into riparian reserve.

Construction of formidable log jams at a restored side-channel inlet will guide flow into the 2,900-foot side-channel and currently isolated 30-acre floodplain, which was acquired in 2007 for conservation management by Columbia Land Trust.  Steps to reduce channel confinement will re-activate side-channel flow approximately 10 months per year and link off-channel habitat for coho rearing.   This restoration addresses reach-specific limiting factors for ESA-listed wild salmon and steelhead within the basin-wide restoration strategy.  Proposed project represents an initial phase of further side-channel reconnections identified by reach-scale geomorphic analysis.  This initial phase will assist public agencies and private landowners in understanding the process of opening side-channels to capture benefits of large-scale restoration in the 10 mile project reach that will extend a restoration corridor on the mainstem Sandy and link restored habitats upstream and downstream.
