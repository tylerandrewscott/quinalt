class="cmr-10">There is a large body of literature in the field of environmental learning and education that challenges</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">the overly sanguine perspective on the impacts of education and outreach, what Heimlich (2010, p. 183) refers to</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">as the false causality of knowledge or attitude leading to behavior, that increasing stakeholder understanding or</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">concern will lead to behavioral change (e.g., Hungerford and Volk 1990, Sia et al. 1985). However, Hines et al.</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">(1987) do find in a large-scale meta-analysis of education and outreach program evaluations that issue and</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">action strategy knowledge, sense of responsibility, locus of control, and verbal commitment are all associated</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">with responsible environmental behaviors. Heimlichs (2010) contention is thus not that education and</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">outreach have no impact in practice, but rather that the theoretical model of this process is highly</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">complex.</span></div>
