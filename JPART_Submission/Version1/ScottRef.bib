Traditional approaches do not provide solutions to wicked problems. These challenges are stimulating alternative theory and practices around the world. Integrating existing theories and research from case studies, the authors argue that collaborative decision-making is a powerful method for getting beyond division and conflict to craft policy solutions and generate capacity for long term sustainability. They outline a new theory of collaborative rationality to help make sense of the new practices. They inquire in detail how collaborative rationality works, the theories that inform it, and the potential and pitfalls of democracy in the twenty-first {century."--Provided} by publisher.},

The dolphin-safe ecolabel appears to have played a minor role in a reduction of dolphin mortality in tuna fisheries, but dolphin populations in the worst-affected area have not recovered, and it appears that the current level of dolphin by-catch sanctioned by present-day fishery management and the ecolabel is not effective enough to achieve population recovery. The {MSC} ecolabel has established a poorly expressed environmental standard that has resulted in variable interpretations by certifiers, creating an apparently systematic bias in application of the standard to the certified fisheries. Without substantial revision of both these systems, it seems unlikely that they will be able to make major contributions to marine biodiversity conservation because of barriers created by limitations in programme design, lack of robust linkages between the certification standard and biodiversity conservation outcomes, and unclear standards and their inconsistent application in the certification of fisheries.}

Empirical studies of information in organizations portray a pattern that is hard to rationalize in such terms. In particular, organizations systematically gather more information than they use, yet continue to ask for more. We suggest that this behavior is a consequence of some ways in which organizational settings for information use differ from those anticipated in a simple decision-theory vision. In particular, the use of information is embedded in social norms that make it highly symbolic. Some of the implications of such a pattern of information use are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We argue that certifications that seek to raise ecological and social expectations are likely to be increasingly challenged by those that seek to simply uphold current standards. The vulnerability of these initiatives to market pressures highlights the need for private regulation to work in tandem with public regulation in enhancing social and environmental sustainability.}

Everyone knows that the American welfare state is less expensive and extensive, later to develop and slower to grow, than comparable programs abroad. American social spending is as high as spending in many European nations. What is distinctive is that so many social welfare duties are handled by the private sector with government support. With historical reach and statistical and cross-national evidence, The divided welfare state demonstrates that private social benefits have not been shaped by public policy, but have deeply influenced the politics of public social programs-to produce a social policy framework whose political and social effects are strikingly different than often assumed.}

But, although the Stern Review emphasises the ethical nature of the parameters entering into its choice of a relativey low discount rate, no consideration is given to the role of 'agent-relative ethics,' which (i) has a well-established philosophical pedigree going back to David Hume, (ii) is likely to correspond cosely to world-wide public attitudes towards intergenerational welfare; and (iii) would entail discounting a unit of welfare accruing to future generations compared to an dqual unit accruing to people alive today at a positive rate. The authors also discuss the other ethical parameter upon wich the discount rate depends, namely the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to consumption. In the conventional model, this simultaneously reflects different apects of inequality aversion as well as risk aversion, which complicates its discount and the low rate chosen in the Review, and the limitations - on the one hand - on the normative significance of market rates, as well as the danger - on the other hand - of relying on rates chosen by elites or philosopher kings. {[PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT]}}

How are we to account for the current prestige and power of quantitative methods? The usual answer is that quantification is seen as desirable in social and economic investigation as a result of its successes in the study of nature. Theodore Porter is not content with this. Why should the kind of success achieved in the study of stars, molecules, or cells be an attractive model for research on human societies? he asks. And, indeed, how should we understand the pervasiveness of quantification in the sciences of nature? In his view, we should look in the reverse direction: comprehending the attractions of quantification in business, government, and social research will teach us something new about its role in psychology, physics, and medicine. Drawing on a wide range of examples from the laboratory and from the worlds of accounting, insurance, cost-benefit analysis, and civil engineering, Porter shows that it is "exactly wrong" to interpret the drive for quantitative rigor as inherent somehow in the activity of science except where political and social pressures force compromise. Instead, quantification grows from attempts to develop a strategy of impersonality in response to pressures from outside. Objectivity derives its impetus from cultural contexts, quantification becoming most important where elites are weak, where private negotiation is suspect, and where trust is in short supply.}

This article describes and analyses the criteria applied by four different eco-labelling schemes for seafood products from capture fisheries, and discusses the criteria in terms of environmental impacts, based on the {ISO} 14040 standard for life cycle assessment. It is concluded that the most widespread eco-label, the Marine Stewardship Council {(MSC)}, mainly addresses the fishing stage, in particular the overexploitation of marine resources. {LCA} studies confirm that the fishing stage represents the most significant environmental burden, but energy consumption and emissions of anti-fouling agents at the fishing or harvesting stage contribute with significant impacts that are not being addressed by international labelling initiatives for wild-caught seafood. {LCA} studies show that significant environmental impacts are related to the life cycle stages after landing. This includes fish processing, transport, cooling and packaging (especially for highly processed seafood products). Hence, another challenge would be to include criteria related to the post-landing consumption of energy, certain materials and chemicals, waste handling and wastewater emissions. Minimizing product losses throughout the product chain would also be an important area for future criteria in order to avoid fishing at high environmental costs only to produce something that is later wasted. The analysis shows that the Swedish {KRAV} is the only one that currently addresses a range of issues that include energy and chemicals in the whole life cycle of the products. International initiatives such as {MSC} cover fish products from many parts of the world emphasizing 'overexploitation of fish resources'. It is recommended, however, that international initiatives such as {MSC} develop criteria related to energy use and chemicals - at least at the fishing stage. Over time, other life cycle stages could be addressed as well to the extent that this is manageable.}

I find that students in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program had faster math score gains than, but similar reading score gains to, the comparison groups.

This trend of increasing consumption has brought with it negative consequences for the environment and human well-being. Global demand for energy, food, and all manner of goods is on the rise, putting strains on the natural and human capital required to produce them. Extractive industries and production processes are prominent causes of species endangerment. Modern economies are underpinned by substantial energy consumption, a primary contributor to the current climate crisis. Expanding international trade has led to many economic opportunities, but has also contributed to unfair labor practices and wealth disparities. While certain processes have improved or become more efficient, and certain practices have been outlawed or amended, the sheer scale of global consumption and its attendant impacts continue to be major challenges we face in the transition to sustainability. Third-party certification systems have emerged over the last 15 years as a tool with some promise. There has been anecdotal evidence of success, but to date the overall impact of certified goods and services has been small. Moreover, definitions of sustainable vary across sectors and markets, and rigorous assessments of these programs have been few and far between. In order to take a step in learning from this field of practice, the National Academies' Science and Technology for Sustainability Program held a workshop to illuminate the decision making process of those who purchase and produce certified goods and services. It was also intended to help clarify the scope and limitations of the scientific knowledge that might contribute to the economic success of certified products. The workshop, summarized in this volume, involved presentations and discussions with approximately 40 invited experts from academia, business, government, and nongovernmental {organizations."--Publisher's} website.}

More specifically, we address: (1) whether imposed interdependencies affect the extent to which shared beliefs are related to coordinated behavior; and (2) which types of beliefs are the principal 'glue' of coordination. We then examine the implications of these hypotheses in an empirical analysis of ally networks in San Francisco {Bay-Delta} water policy. Our empirical results suggest that both belief congruence and functional interdependence are important for understanding coordination. Further, the types of beliefs critical to coordination are consistent with the underlying rationale-but not necessarily the specific hypotheses-of the Advocacy Coalition Framework.}

Many previous empirical evidences suggest that fragmented governments are able to collaborate to share information even in the highly competitive economic development arena. This situation makes local officials in metro areas confront inevitable trade-offs between the potential benefits of interdependent policy action and uncertainties around selective incentives of participating governments. Especially, elected officials' aversion to risk and short time horizons make them sensitive to possibilities of being misled by wrong or irrelevant {information.The} authors contend that elected officials seek partners embedded in a structure of relationships that can reduce the political risks of collaboration as well as provide information, commitment that is necessary to overcome the barriers to collective action. The authors apply an exponential random graph (p*) model to test if certain hypothesized network structures are more likely to emerge in self-organizing economic development networks among local elected officials. The results generally confirm that when there are greater commitment risks to collaboration, the actors are more likely to create mechanisms that can enhance trustworthiness to resolve cooperative problems.},

We describe an approach to developing {MMIs} of ecological condition that is applicable to a variety of biological assemblage types and to spatially extensive (regional, national) aquatic resource surveys. The process involves testing the performance characteristics of candidate metrics in several categories that correspond to key dimensions of biotic condition. The performance characteristics include: information content (range), reproducibility, calibration for natural gradients, responsiveness to stressor gradients, and independence from other metrics. The best-performing metric from each category is included in the final {MMI.} The consistency of the process enables development of separate {MMIs} in different regions that can be combined in a national assessment and that are more comparable across regions and taxonomic groups than a set of independently developed {MMIs} would be. We provide an example of the process applied to macroinvertebrate data from the {US} Environmental Protection Agency's Wadeable Streams Assessment {(WSA)} from 3045 sites (of which 1390 were {WSA} probability sites). The {MMIs} developed for the {WSA} demonstrate the feasibility of conducting bioassessments at continental scales and provide a basis for interpreting existing {MMIs} from regional- and national-level perspectives.},

Organizations whose structures become isomorphic with the myths of the institutional environment-in contrast with those primarily structured by the demands of technical production and exchange-decrease internal coordination and control in order to maintain legitimacy. Structures are decoupled from each other and from ongoing activities. In place of coordination, inspection, and evaluation, a logic of confidence and good faith is employed.}

Selection bias undermines the benefits of randomization when the treatment, a random offer of a voucher, is declined by participants who systematically differ from those who accept. This article argues that the complier average causal effect {(CACE)} is the parameter of interest in voucher evaluations. As an example, the {CACE} is estimated using data from a small, one-year field trial of vouchers in Charlotte, {NC.} In this estimation, voucher impacts in Charlotte are positive, but appear to be moderated by the probability of compliance. For math achievement, maximum likelihood {CACE} estimates are smaller and insignificant compared to intention to treat and instrumental variable estimates of mean treatment effects.},

	abstract = {The past two decades have seen a wholesale rethinking and reworking of public policy and have provided geographers with a major opportunity to enter and help shape the policy debated. Yet, disappointingly, the effect of geography on the policy realm has been limited. Increasingly, it seems, other social, political, and environmental scientists, and even media pundits, shape public perception and government policy in areas where geographers could-indeed should-be having much greater influence. In this article, the authors examine the reasons for this state of affairs. The fundamental problem, he contends, is that for several reasons, much contemporary social and economic geographic research renders it of little practical relevance for policy, in some cases of little social relevance at all. The more significant reasons for this lack of relevance to, and influence on, the policy realm include the following: the effect on the subject of the postmodern and cultural "turns"; the consequential emphasis on "sexy" philosophical, linguistic, and theoretical issues rather than on practical social research; the retreat from detailed, rigorous empirical work; the intellectual bias against policy studies; and the lack of political commitment. The article makes a plea for a new "policy turn" in the discipline and concludes with some tentative suggestions as to how geographers might move toward a discipline of public policy.},

However, little attention has been systematically paid to how compliance with them has been achieved. An analysis of the Mediterranean Action Plan, a coordinated effort to protect the Mediterranean Sea from pollution, shows that this regime actually served to empower a group of experts (members of an epistemic community), who were then able to redirect their governments toward the pursuit of new objectives. Acting in an effective transnational coalition, these new actors contributed to the development of convergent state policies in compliance with the regime and were also effective in promoting stronger and broader rules for pollution control. This suggests that in addition to providing a form of order in an anarchic international political system, regimes may also contribute to governmental learning and influence patterns of behavior by empowering new groups who are able to direct their governments toward new ends.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Declines in real benefits due to inflation lead to the appearance of high benefit "welfare magnets" cutting their payments more dramatically than lower benefit states and to a correlation in benefit changes across the states. This article argues that a more accurate specification of welfare politics focuses on the presence or absence of actual legislated payment increases in the face of inflation. Logit and ordered logit analyses of payment changes under the {AFDC} program in the states from 1975 to 1990 show the role of inflation and political considerations in determining benefit adjustments. Rather than states actively undercutting one another to avoid becoming welfare magnets, this article supports a different version of competitive federalism. States wish to increase their welfare benefits, but hesitate until neighboring states do the same. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.}

Efficient trading mechanisms are more readily implemented when there is a strong political or legal mandate to cap resource use and trades are perceived as a means to ease adjustment to use limits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Only two of those arguments provide plausible justifications for time-discounting at all; and neither of those justify a constant rate throughout all periods or for all goods. Indeed, there is an important class of 'nontradable' goods which can be discounted only in their own terms. The overall conclusion is that policymakers ought, logically as well as morally, to weight the interests of the future far more heavily than in ordinary discounting procedures.}

The risk hypothesis argues that actors seek bridging relationships (well-connected, popular partners that maximize their access to information) when cooperation involves low risks, but seek bonding relationships (transitive, reciprocal relationships that maximize credibility) when risks of defection increase. We test this hypothesis in newly developing policy arenas expected to favor relationships that resolve low-risk dilemmas. A stochastic actor-based model for network evolution estimated with survey data from 1999 and 2001 in 10 {U.S.} estuaries finds that actors do tend to select popular actors as partners, which presumably creates a centralized bridging structure capable of efficient information transmission for coordinating policies even without any government mandate. Actors also seek reciprocal bonding relationships supportive of small joint projects and quickly learn whether or not to trust their partners.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Hall's social learning model, in which unsuccessful efforts by state officials to respond to policy failures and anomalies in the existing paradigm eventually trigger a broader, societal, political partisan debate about policy principles. From this society-wide contestation over policy goals, problems, and solutions, a new policy paradigm emerges. Drawing on the conceptual tools of policy feedback and policy networks, this article describes an alternative route to paradigm shift in which change is negotiated between state actors and group representatives. Discussions of change are largely confined to sectoral policy networks and the result is a more managed series of policy changes that culminate in a paradigm shift. This argument for a second, cumulative trajectory to paradigm shift is developed by examining agricultural policy change in three countries: the United States, Canada, and Australia.}

Yet, disappointingly, the effect of geography on the policy realm has been limited. Increasingly, it seems, other social, political, and environmental scientists, and even media pundits, shape public perception and government policy in areas where geographers could-indeed should-be having much greater influence. In this article, the authors examine the reasons for this state of affairs. The fundamental problem, he contends, is that for several reasons, much contemporary social and economic geographic research renders it of little practical relevance for policy, in some cases of little social relevance at all. The more significant reasons for this lack of relevance to, and influence on, the policy realm include the following: the effect on the subject of the postmodern and cultural "turns"; the consequential emphasis on "sexy" philosophical, linguistic, and theoretical issues rather than on practical social research; the retreat from detailed, rigorous empirical work; the intellectual bias against policy studies; and the lack of political commitment. The article makes a plea for a new "policy turn" in the discipline and concludes with some tentative suggestions as to how geographers might move toward a discipline of public policy.},

The concern for the environment goes back more than a century, surely, but Kirkpatrick Sale shows that not until 1962, when Rachel Carson's Silent Spring electrified the country, did we begin to realize the terrible danger of man-made threats to our natural world. Our national environmental organizations and leading scientists have given us a new lexicon: acid rain, toxic wastes, biodiversity, the greenhouse effect. Even the word "green" has taken on a new meaning. Tragic events - at Bhopal, Love Canal, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl - that once would have been thought of as ephemeral are unforgettable warnings. Congress has responded with major legislation to protect the land, our forests, wildlife, water, and the air we breathe. Even so, as Sale reminds us, these years have not been an unmitigated triumph. The perils to the earth remain and in some ways are even more ominous. But never in the annals of social change has a movement gained as much popular support, never has it had such legislative and regulatory impact, never has it become so embedded in an entire culture. It may not save the world, but what else will?}

The class of models considered here includes both models in which the parameters are identifiable and also models in which the parameters are not. For each of the models considered here, a relatively simple method is presented for calculating the maximum likelihood estimate of the frequencies in the m-way contingency table expected under the model, and for determining whether the parameters in the estimated model are identifiable. In addition, methods are presented for testing whether the model fits the observed data, and for replacing unidentifiable models that fit by identifiable models that fit. Some illustrative applications to data are also included.}

We then discuss various issues in the implementation of domestic emissions control policy, instrument choice, and incentives for technological innovation. Finally, we discuss alternative policy architectures at the international level.}

We begin by reconceptualizing the theory of boundary organizations, bringing it into greater alignment with the realities of the current university environment. Using in-depth interviews, documentary analysis and ethnographic field work, this framework is applied to a university-based boundary organization attempting to reconcile the needs of water policymakers, university administrators, university departments, and funding agencies. These stakeholders place diverse, conflicting demands on the boundary organization. Those demands create four sets of enduring tensions requiring ongoing management by the boundary organization. However, the ability to manage these tensions is structured by constituents{\textquoteright} relative levels of power, legitimacy, and saliency. We show the importance of adaptive boundary management for managing these enduring tensions, while also concluding that the demands of some stakeholders may be incommensurable. The article closes with a number of concrete suggestions for enhancing the efficacy of university-based boundary organizations.},

A favored model for public input is to use the tools of dispute resolution to seek consensus among members of a multi-party stakeholder group. The authors believe that a focus on dispute resolution and consensus building can pose impediments to the creation of insights for decisionmakers and lead to the adoption of inferior policy choices. Instead, they advocate an alternative approach to stakeholder participation characterized as decision aiding through a structured process based on constructive, multi-attribute techniques and value-focused thinking. In this paper some of the major difficulties posed by a dispute-resolution approach are articulated, the principles of a decision-aiding process reviewed, and this alternative approach illustrated by describing a stakeholder consultation involving water-use planning for a hydroelectric facility on the Alouette River in British Columbia, Canada.},

Peter Haas refined the concept of epistemic community to explain international cooperation. I import the concept from the international to the domestic level and test some hypotheses of epistemic influence using a case study of cooperation among resource management agencies in California. Epistemic communities are like-minded networks of professionals whose authoritative claim to consensual knowledge provides them with a unique source of power in decision-making processes. Ecologists make up an epistemic community distinct from those in other life sciences because they study systems of relationships in the natural world rather than analyze biotic parts in isolation from the whole. Since ecological systems transcend agency jurisdictions, ecologists view interagency relationships much differently than do other agency officials. Ecologists accept interdependence among public agencies, and even welcome it, while agency executives generally seek autonomy from one another in order to provide stability and certainty for their organizational units. Agency executives may, however, adopt an epistemic community's logic of interdependence and cooperation if it helps them cope with uncertainty in their organizational environments. Since contextual factors shape epistemic influence, the theory of international cooperation developed by Peter Haas needs to be modified when applied within the United States to account for the different context of public agencies, particularly the laws shaping agency behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The influence of past land use on the present-day diversity of stream invertebrates and fish was investigated by comparing watersheds with different land-use history. Whole watershed land use in the 1950s was the best predictor of present-day diversity, whereas riparian land use and watershed land use in the 1990s were comparatively poor indicators. Our findings indicate that past land-use activity, particularly agriculture, may result in long-term modifications to and reductions in aquatic diversity, regardless of reforestation of riparian zones. Preservation of habitat fragments may not be sufficient to maintain natural diversity in streams, and maintenance of such biodiversity may require conservation of much or all of the watershed.},

It is demonstrated that in a two-period problem, discounting at the Treasury rate always results in the correct investment decision. In other words, the winning project may always be transformed, through market deals, into one that dominates the losing project. Some anomalies take place when assessing projects of longer duration, but these are probably not significant empirically. In addition, the dominating project may be calculated using linear programming.}

For each of the models considered here, a relatively simple method is presented for calculating the maximum likelihood estimate of the frequencies in the m-way contingency table expected under the model, and for determining whether the parameters in the estimated model are identifiable. In addition, methods are presented for testing whether the model fits the observed data, and for replacing unidentifiable models that fit by identifiable models that fit.

Not much attention has been paid so far to strategies aimed at institutional design. Therefore, in this article, we develop a conceptual framework to study institutional design more thoroughly. We do this by specifying the nature and variety of institutional rules that guide the behaviour of actors within networks. Given this categorization of rules, we identify possible strategies to change network rules. Next, we focus on the strategic context of attempts to influence the nature of institutional rules: the process of institutional design. We conclude with suggestions to apply the conceptual framework to empirical research into the forms, impacts and implications of attempts to change the institutional features of policy networks.},

Moving from the prehistoric Polynesian culture on Easter Island to the formerly flourishing Native American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya, the doomed medieval Viking colony on Greenland, and finally to the modern world, Diamond traces a fundamental pattern of catastrophe, spelling out what happens when we squander our resources, when we ignore the signals our environment gives us, and when we reproduce too fast or cut down too many trees. Environmental damage, climate change, rapid population growth, unstable trade partners, and pressure from enemies were all factors in the demise of the doomed societies, but other societies found solutions to those same problems and {persisted."--Jacket.}}

Recent empirical work on identities, interests, alternatives, and political innovation illustrates how political scientists and sociologists have begun to document the consequences of institutional contradiction and multiplicity and to trace the workings of institutional containment, diffusion, and mediation.

Data were collected from students and their parents at baseline and in the spring of each of the next 3 years. Students with missing baseline test scores, which encompasses all those who were initially in kindergarten and 11\% of those initially in Grades 1 to 4, were excluded from previous analyses of achievement, even thoughthese students were tested in the follow-up years. In principle, random assignment would be expected to lead treatment status to be uncorrelated with all baseline characteristics.

When a project's outputs are perfect substitutes for private consumption, both its costs and beenfits should be discounted using the marginal productivity of capital. However, if the project's outputs are separable in the utility function, the benefits should be discounted using the net (of tax) rate of return. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.}

Meanwhile, people with important ideas--business people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and others--struggle to make their ideas "stick." Why do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? Educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the "human scale principle," using the {"Velcro} Theory of Memory," and creating "curiosity gaps." In this fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures), we discover that sticky messages of all kinds--from the infamous "kidney theft ring" hoax to a coach's lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony--draw their power from the same six traits.
