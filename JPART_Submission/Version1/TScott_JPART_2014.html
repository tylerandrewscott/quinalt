<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   This paper couples data concerning 2500 grants given to local watershed management
councils by an Oregon state agency, the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board (OWEB), with
20 years of monthly water quality data sampled at 141 sites around the state. I examine
whether public input, in the form of grant funding, to nonprofit watershed councils impacts
water quality, and further compare the impacts of different grant types, such as restoration
projects or stakeholder outreach. These data present some of the first evidence regarding the
effect of collaborative management outputs on environmental outcomes (Carr et al. 2012;
Koontz and Thomas 2006). In modeling these effects, this paper also makes a methodological
contribution by demonstrating how spatio-temporal ecological and epidemiological
modeling techniques can be used to test policy theory and analyze policy impacts using
extant data. Specifically, I use integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) (Rue
et al. 2009) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) (Lindgren et al.
2011) to fit a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounts for spatial and temporal
dependency. I find that increased public support (in the form of OWEB grant funds) for
nonprofit watershed council education and outreach actions are strongly linked to water
quality improvements. Support for council administrative purposes and scientific
or technical activities are also associated with improved water quality over longer
timer periods. The impacts of restoration projects are positive on average but more
uncertain.<br

<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >Governments increasingly rely on collaborative relationships with non-profit organizations to
implement policies or provide services (Salamon 2002). Collaborative management with local
nonprofit groups gives governments a community-based vehicle through which to
implement policies and programs, and provide nonprofits with access to funding and other
resources (Nikolic and Koontz 2008). Management arrangements of this form are very
common in environmental applications, particularly watershed management and
water quality (e.g., Leach et al. 2013; Leach et al. 2002; Margerum 2011; Hardy and
Koontz 2008). This paper builds on the considerable body of research discussing the
role that governments play in&#8211;and resultant impacts of&#8211;supporting collaborative
management (e.g., Nikolic and Koontz 2008; Lubell and Fulton 2008; Ansell and Gash
2008; Emerson et al. 2012; Scott and Thomas 2014) by asking a relatively simple
question that proves highly elusive in practice: How does government support for
collaborative management affect environmental outcomes? To examine this question, I use
publically available water quality monitoring data to explore the impact of 2500 grants
given by a state agency, the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board (OWEB), to
local non-profit stakeholder councils engaged in ongoing watershed planning and
management activities in watersheds across Oregon over the course of almost 20
years.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   To model these effects I use Bayesian hierarchical modeling, specifically Integrated Nested
Laplace Approximation (INLA) (Rue et al. 2009) for estimating complex hierarchical models
and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) (Lindgren et al. 2011) for modeling
spatial and temporal dependency, in order to account for the complex spatio-temporal nature of
these data. This paper makes a methodological contribution to the policy literature by helping
to establish the use of these methods for policy evaluation. The INLA approach facilitates
large-scale hierarchical models and complex specifications that account for irregular data

and spatial and temporal relationships. This enables the use of publicly available,
observational environmental data and helps address some of the analytical challenges
that have prevented researchers from linking collaborative management efforts to
environmental outcomes in the past (Koontz and Thomas 2006; Thomas and Koontz
2011).
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   Using this model, I address two primary research questions: (1) Does government funding
for collaborative watershed management groups have a measurable impact on water quality?
and (2) How does this impact compare across different types of funded programs? Specifically,
how does the predicted effect on water quality of funding collaborative group activities that
have a direct environmental output (e.g., riparian revegetation) compare to supporting
production of indirect outputs (e.g., supporting council administrative activities, which in turn
shape future environmental outputs)? In what follows, I first describe the theoretical rationale
for this research, and then provide background concerning the case analyzed. I then specify my
analytical approach and introduce the INLA and SPDE methods. The remaining
sections present the data and model results, and discuss the implications of these
findings.
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Rationale</h3>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >The idea that policy implementation does not solely involve autonomous actions by public
agencies is long-established (e.g., Ostrom et al. 1961) and ubiquitous in modern policymaking
(Salamon 2002, p. 8). In fact, it is unclear in practice what an alternative to the general
concept of collaboration (Donahue and Zeckhauser 2011; Agranoff and McGuire 2003), in
which government agencies communicate, consult, coordinate, or cooperate with
other public, private, and nonprofit entities, would even be. A stricter definition of
collaborative management, which involves government initiation and/or funding (Ansell
and Gash 2008) for efforts in which a group of autonomous stakeholders deliberates
to build consensus and develop networks (Margerum 2011, p. 6) in order to make

or implement public policy or manage public programs or assets (Ansell and Gash
2008, p. 544), raises a more interesting issue: collaboration by this definition does not
just happen, but rather policymakers choose collaborative management as a means
through which to design and implement policies (Layzer 2008; Hoornbeek et al. 2012;
Koontz et al. 2004). Does using funding nonprofit collaborative stakeholder groups
result in improved environmental outcomes? For instance, is it more beneficial for
the state of Oregon to implement a restoration project directly or to provide grant
funds to a local nonprofit watershed council to implement the restoration project
instead?
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   While collaborative management is heavily documented in the policy and management
literatures (Emerson et al. 2012; Margerum 2011; Sabatier et al. 2005; Ansell and Gash 2008;
Lubell 2004), the complexity of social-environmental systems makes it difficult to trace how
government support for non-profit collaborative groups ultimately impacts environmental
outcomes (Koontz and Thomas 2006; Thomas and Koontz 2011). Clearly, the context of a
particular locale or project greatly determines the answer to this question. More broadly,
however, the literature concerning collaborative management provides a theoretical basis to
help understand the rationale for governments to partner with nonprofit collaborative groups.
The general rationale for supporting collaborative management, such as by funding a
nonprofit collaborative management group, is that collaborative efforts yield more
holistic and comprehensive management. For instance, collaborative management is
shown to enhance cooperation amongst stakeholders (Lubell 2004), alter existing
stakeholder beliefs (Leach et al. 2013), increase information exchange and learning
amongst actors (Beierle 2002; Weible et al. 2009), foster trust and collective action
(Lubell 2005), and incorporate a broader range of information (Innes and Booher 1999;
Wondolleck and Yaffee 2000). Local nonprofit collaborative groups can be flexible
and responsiveness, pivoting to meet local needs and concerns (Nikolic and Koontz
2008).
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, since collaborative management is deliberative and consensus-oriented
(Ansell and Gash 2008), it can involve a great deal of time and effort (Margerum 2011).

Further, in contrast with direct government action in which the implementing agency has
stricter control over policy efforts (Salamon 2002), policy implementation via collaborative
management has a heightened degree of uncertainty from the perspective of the funding agency
since the involvement of more actors creates issues of accountability and control (Weber 2003).
There is also concern that government support for local collaborative management efforts can
detract from the ability of these local organizations to operate with responsiveness and
flexibility, reducing the very qualities that are presumed to make such groups effective (Smith
2004; Nikolic and Koontz 2008).
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   Nonetheless, the use of collaborative management continues to proliferate (Ansell and Gash
2008; Emerson et al. 2012) as a response to complex environmental problems (Margerum 2011).
Among the practical rationales for public managers to choose collaborative management are the
expectations that collaborative management will facilitate a more comprehensive understanding
of policy problems (Leach et al. 2013), alleviate conflict between stakeholders (Berardo
et al. 2014), reduce interorganizational transaction costs (Emerson et al. 2012; Scott
and Thomas 2014), and foster greater buy-in from stakeholders (Ansell and Gash
2008). In short, policymakers believe that collaborative management will improve the
design and implementation of policies and programs and thereby improve policy
outcomes.
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Background</h3>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Nonprofit watershed councils in the state of Oregon have proved to be a fruitful
object of study for those interested in collaborative management (Griffin 1999; Dakins
et al. 2005; Margerum 2002, 2007, 2008; Margerum 2011; Habron 2003; Margerum
and Whitall 2004; Hibbard and Lurie 2006; Lurie and Hibbard 2008). My study
differs significantly from the cited works in that none of these analyses evaluate the
impact that these councils have on water quality on a long-term, statewide basis (most
involve intensive case studies that focus on specific watersheds). Created by the state

legislature in 1995, OWEB provides guidance, administrative support, and resources to 87
local watershed councils. This support includes grants to local watershed councils
for myriad purposes ranging from environmental assessment to hiring a full-time
coordinator. Because grants are awarded by OWEB on a competitive basis, these data
are not suitable for providing a generalizable estimate of how funding collaborative
management in a randomly selected watershed improves water quality. This is because the
grant application and approval process is intended to identify and select motivated
parties and favorable circumstances, which results in selection bias at the watershed
level of analysis. However, what is really of interest in this case is the efficacy of
Oregon&#8217;s statewide support of a collaborative watershed management system. The case
that I consider is the state of Oregons ongoing financial support for collaborative
watershed management. In other words, the purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the
statewide OWEB watershed management strategy (of providing public funds to nonprofit
management councils) by modeling whether providing funds to watershed councils
corresponds to improved water quality. It is difficult to envision a state or regional program
not administered on similar grounds (with funds strategically allocated), and thus
this analysis thus provides a good conception of the effectiveness of a grant-funded
collaborative watershed management system implemented at a regional governance
level.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Hypotheses</h3>
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >The OWEB statewide, grant-based system also provides a unique way to address one of the
challenges typically faced in estimating the impact of collaborative groups: even
if budget data are available, it is difficult to determine the activities and relative
effort level of each group. OWEB grant funds provide a consistent approximation of
collaborative management effort taking place in given place and time in the state.
Rather than simply comparing collaborative and non-collaborative watersheds, grant

funding provides a continuous metric of collaborative management that can be used to
estimate how increased support for collaborative management relates to environmental
outcomes. If collaborative watershed management has an impact on water quality,
greater support (as measured by grant funding in this case) should result in a larger
impact:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-12">Hypothesis 1: Grant funds given to nonprofit watershed councils improve water</span>
      <span 
class="cmti-12">quality in the targeted watershed.</span></li></ul>
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   Building upon this basic hypothesis, I then distinguish between grants that more directly
target water quality through environmental restoration projects and grants that indirectly
target water quality by funding: (1) assessment, monitoring, and other technical actions; (2)
educational and outreach programs; and (3) council activities and personnel. Program logic
(Bickman 1987), the narrative for how a given program will work to address an identified
problem (Margerum 2011; McLaughlin and Jordan 1999), differs greatly for these different
types of grants, particularly between restoration projects and the three non-restoration project
types. In a simplistic sense, restoration projects can be viewed as a direct purchase of
environmental outputs; Typical restoration projects implemented by watershed groups
include abatement or prevention of nonpoint or point pollution sources, in-stream
flow modifications or water allocation, stream channel restoration, and changes in
land-use designations (Leach et al. 2002). These outputs directly contribute to water
quality by altering physical conditions. While the extent to which these outputs
will alter environmental outcomes might be uncertain, the program logic is fairly
straightforward.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Conversely, grant types, including for assessment and monitoring, education and outreach,
and council administrative actions, might best be characterized as an investment: Instead of
directly purchasing environmental outputs, the program logic of supporting non-restorative
actions is essentially that investing in council efforts that produce non-environmental outputs
will ultimately engender a return in environmental outputs&#8211;and thus outcomes&#8211;over time.

Much of the collaborative management literature implicitly revolves around this idea.
Monitoring and assessment projects, for instance, provide data and information that managers
can use for adaptive policymaking (Huntington 2000; Leach et al. 2002; Yaffee et al. 1996). The
program logic for investing in monitoring and assessment is that investing in better information
will facilitate improved management practices and decision-making, which will thereby result in
improved outcomes.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Similarly, outreach projects seek to build community support for environmental efforts in a
watershed (Huntington 2000) and educational projects seek to foster agreement on how to
improve a watershed (when internal to the council) (Leach et al. 2002) or to promote
environmentally responsible behaviors (when external to the council) (Nikolic and Koontz
2008). Education and outreach program logic is that such programs foster learning that alters
stakeholder beliefs and practices (e.g., Leach et al. 2013; Leach et al. 2002) or build
community support and motivation (Huntington 2000; Emerson et al. 2012), serving
to change environmental behaviors or improve implementation efforts and in turn
improving environmental outcomes. For instance, Lubell and Fulton (2008) demonstrate
that increased exposure to policy networks, such as might be fostered through an
outreach project, increases the probability that landowners will adopt environmental
practices.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="TScott_JPART_20142.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-4001f1"></a>
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Finally, council support grants fund group coordinators and group administrative functions.
In other words, these types of grants support the existence and operation of the nonprofit

watershed council itself. Collaborative management is theorized to engender principled
engagement amongst participants that fosters shared motivation, which in turn enables joint
actions which could not be accomplished separately (Emerson et al. 2012). Adequate support is
shown to be critical to for collaborative efforts to be successful in this regard (Lubell
et al. 2009). In particular, there are significant transaction costs associated with
initiating and maintaining inter-organizational endeavors, and government provision of
staffing, infrastructure, and other resources are shown facilitate such efforts (Schneider
et al. 2003). Emerson et al. (2012) theorize that collaborative actions are likely to be
implemented only to the extent to which the three collaborative dynamics (principled
engagement, shared motivation, and capacity for joint action) function. Thus, to put
a fine point on a broad and nuanced literature, the program logic for investing in
council support is that a well-functioning collaborative group will result in policy and
program outputs that draw on more relevant perspectives (Ansell and Gash 2008;
O&#8216;Leary et al. 2006; Leach 2006), have increased commitment from participants (Bryson
et al. 2006; Ansell and Gash 2008), and could not be produced separately (Emerson
et al. 2012), and that these improved outputs will result in improved environmental
outcomes.
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   As with any investment, the program logic for each type of grant speaks to a tradeoff of risk
and reward. For instance, education projects are affordable and easy to carry out (Leach et al.
2002), but have a much more uncertain causal link to environmental outcomes than do projects
that produce direct environmental outputs. If a project does not alter stakeholder
behavior, or if the impacts of stakeholder behaviors are relatively minor in the grand
scheme of things, then it will not change environmental outcomes at all. However,
if a project is successful in changing consequential stakeholder behaviors or helps
the community agree on necessary improvement steps, then it might result in large
changes in environmental outcomes at the cost of producing relatively inexpensive
outputs. Similarly, a relatively minor investment in improving processes and policies via
collaborative approaches might result in considerable impact. With the exception of certain
economies of scale, such as that achieved by improving habitat connectivity, OWEB

essentially gets only us much restoration as it pays for; other nonprofit watershed council
activities can potentially produce more environmental outputs in excess of the original
expenditure.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   However, as mentioned previously the literature also emphasizes the time-consuming nature
of collaborative management (e.g., Margerum 2011; Ansell and Gash 2008; Imperial 2005) and
expresses skepticism about possible achievements of deliberative, consensus-based policymaking
(Coglianese 2003; Gunton 2003). In any case, since we do not know a great deal about the
relationship between collaborative management outputs and environmental outcomes generally
(Carr et al. 2012; Koontz and Thomas 2006; Newig and Fritsch 2009), I pose a conservative
hypothesis that assumes that restoration grants, which have the most direct theoretical
causal link between outputs and policy outcomes (e.g., revegetation that directly
alters streamside riparian areas, which has an effect on water quality), will produce
measurable water quality changes and grants for other purposes (with non-environmental
outputs) such as education, outreach, administrative support, and technical support will
not:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmti-12">Hypothesis 2: Grants for restoration will measurably improve water quality, while</span>
      <span 
class="cmti-12">grants for projects that to not have direct environmental outputs will not.</span></li></ul>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Model and Methods</h3>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >In accordance with these hypotheses, the goal of this paper is to estimate the effect of grants
given to watershed councils on water quality. Water quality index observations (<span 
class="cmmi-12">Y</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">itj</span></sub>) occur at
location <span 
class="cmmi-12">i </span>in time period <span 
class="cmmi-12">t </span>within stratum (HUC8 watershed in this case) <span 
class="cmmi-12">j</span>. Standard regression
models are inappropriate in this application, since it is expected that two observations near to
each other in spatial location or time, or within the same administrative boundary (e.g., under
the purview of a given watershed council) are more similar than two randomly selected
observations (and thus exhibit residual dependency, i.e., correlated residuals). These
data are thus highly similar to many epidemiological data contexts, as there is an

outcome (water quality) and a risk factor or confounder (grant funded projects)
and where the spatial (sample sites in the state of Oregon) and temporal (monthly
observations) structure of the data must be accounted for in order to make valid inferences.
Accordingly, I use a suite of Bayesian hierarchical modeling methods found primarily in
the epidemiological (Cameletti et al. 2013; Blangiardo et al. 2010, 2013), spatial
econometrics (Bivand et al. 2008, 2013; Gomez-Rubio et al. 2014), and ecological modeling
(Cosandey-Godin et al. 2014; Clark 2005; Clark and Gelfand 2006; Wikle 2003; Cressie
et al. 2009; Wikle and Hooten 2010; Xu and Wikle 2007; Cressie and Wikle 2011)
literatures.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   A Bayesian model derives a statistical result (the posterior distribution) via an inferential
process that combines the prior distribution (what was assumed prior to observing additional
data) with the current data model (Bernardo and Smith 2009). For this application, there are
two primary advantages of the Bayesian approach. First, since a posterior parameter
distribution is estimated by the model, it is easy to obtain the posterior probability that the
parameter does or does not exceed a given value (Blangiardo et al. 2013); this is easier to
interpret than p-values used in frequentist statistics. Second, Bayesian methods greatly ease the
use of hierarchical model structures, which use random effects to model variance at multiple
levels of a model. The Bayesian model I use includes random effects that model spatial
and temporal dependence amongst observations. Bayesian methods are shown to be
highly effective for analyzing data with this type of spatio-temporal structure (Dunson
2001).
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   Hierarchical Bayesian models are typically fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms which use a simulation-based approach to model the posterior parameter
distributions (Brooks et al. 2011; Robert and Casella 2004; LeSage and Pace 2010).
Since these methods rely on a very large number of simulations applied to complex
model structures, MCMC methods are greatly time- and computationally-intensive
(Blangiardo et al. 2013). In lieu of MCMC, I use a more computationally efficient
method, Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), developed by Rue et al.
(2009) and widely employed for Bayesian hierarchical modeling (Beguin et al. 2012;

Martino et al. 2011; Martino and Rue 2010; Lindgren et al. 2011; Cosandey-Godin et al.
2014).
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   Given that INLA is relatively new and has as-of-yet limited penetration into the policy
literature, along with describing the model specification used in this paper I also provide
background on the INLA estimation method more generally. A full description of the
INLA methodology is beyond the scope of this paper; Rue et al. (2014) and Lindgren
and Rue (2013) provide excellent technical background. Based on the specifications
of Cameletti et al. (2013)and Cosandey-Godin et al. (2014) for a spatio-temporal
point-reference model, water quality observations in a given watershed at a specific time
and location are linked to a structured additive predictor <span

observation <span 
class="cmmi-12">i </span>in a given HUC8 watershed <span 
class="cmmi-12">h</span>. The advantage of fitting a random group
effect as opposed to a fixed effect is twofold. First, the random effect accounts for
differing within-group sample sizes by placing more emphasis on the group mean
when there are many observations in the group and drawing more broadly from the
population mean when there are very few observations in the group (Gelman 2006;
Gelman et al. 2013). This helps ensure that predicted differences between watersheds
are not simply a product of small within-watershed sample sizes by attenuating the
group-level estimates for watersheds with fewer water quality samples towards the
overall mean (producing more conservative group-level estimates than would a basic
fixed-effect approach). Second, and of particular importance for this analysis, is that the
random group effect can itself be modeled as a function of group-level covariates. This
includes important water quality control variables, such as the percentage of land in
the watershed that is developed (e.g., paved or contains buildings) and that is used
for agricultural purposes. It also includes grant funding, the variable(s) of interest.
Since grants are given to watershed councils, it makes the most sense to aggregate
funding at the watershed level. The HUC8-specific adjustment is thus itself modeled

class="cmmi-12">A</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">ij</span></sub> is where the SPDE method enters in. In order to
account for spatial dependence amongst water quality observations, this model includes a
random spatial effect known as a Gaussian random field (GRF) (Cosandey-Godin et al. 2014).
Modeling a continuous spatial process obviously poses a significant, and largely intractable,
computational challenge. The SPDE method posed by Lindgren et al. (2011) indexes the

continuous GRF as a discrete random process, or a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF)
(Lindgren and Rue 2013), by dividing the spatial domain (the state of Oregon in this
case) into a mesh of triangles (Blangiardo et al. 2013). Essentially, this triangular
grid is used to approximate the continuous field. The observation matrix <span 
class="cmmi-12">A </span>contains
the values of the spatio-temporal random field at the specific times and locations
contained in the dataset and uses these values for parameter estimation (Cosandey-Godin
et al. 2014). Since values are only stored for specific points (triangle vertices in the
mesh) (points within a triangle can be estimated by extrapolating between values at
neighboring vertices), this provides considerable computational savings. The latent field is
thus linked to model likelihood via <span

<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >The dependent variable of interest, a water quality index score, is obtained from the Oregon
Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ). The Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) is a
multimetric index that integrates eight water quality variables (temperature, dissolved
oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total
solids, and fecal coliform) into one comprehensive metric (Cude 2001). For each of
these eight subindices, the analytical measurement is converted into a quality rating
between 10 (worst case) and 100 (ideal); ODEQ then uses a harmonic square mean
formula:

class="cmmi-12">S </span>(e.g., pH level), to compute the OWQI
score. In this method, the most impaired variable imparts the greatest influence on overall
index score (Cude 2001), which thus provides a holistic measure of general water quality (since
a site cannot have a relatively high overall score if it performs poorly on any metric). It
is important to note that the OWQI is best suited as a comparative metric; not

only is the index calibrated specifically for streams in the state of Oregon, but it
does not reflect the suitability of water for specific uses (e.g., fishing or swimming).
It does, however, provide an excellent synopsis of overall water quality that allows
for comparison of observations from across the state over time. In particular, the
OWQI is designed to facilitate comparisons between watersheds, and thus sub-indices
such as pH and total solids are adjusted to account for geologic variability (Cude
2001).

every other month. For instance, some stations have observations in June and August while
others have observations in July and September. In a few cases, however, there are only three
or four total monthly observations in total at a given site. One major empirical advantage of
the INLA hierarchical model and the random effects approach I use is that it can readily
handle this type of irregular data. Thus, there is no need to drop any data or to impute
data for undersampled sites or unsampled months. In total, there are 16,676 unique
observations. Figure 1 shows how many observations are included for each of the 141

<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   While in some cases, a grant is targeted at a specific site (as is often the case for restoration
grants), many OWEB grants have a more disparate spatial focus. For instance, an
outreach project might be targeted at an entire watershed or basin. To model the
spatial focus of grants, grants are aggregated by HUC8 for each month (228 months
in total from 1995 to 2013). The total value of a grant is divided by the length of
the project in months to calculate a monthly value of each grant; for instance, a
$60,000 grant project started in March, 2001 and ending in May, 2001 results in a
value of $20,000 for each of March, April, and May. While it is unlikely that grant
funds are expended uniformly in practice, the true model of fund distribution is
unclear from these data. The temporal distribution of funds also likely varies greatly
between projects in any case. Assuming uniform monthly expenditure across the
life of the project provides a consistent approach that is simple to interpret. This
method also provides a consistent treatment of projects ongoing as of December, 2013,
allocating funds in proportion to the portion of the project timeline that has already
passed.
<!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >   Measuring the impact of grants given to watershed councils poses several significant
issues. The effects of a grant do not necessarily correspond directly to the actual
project period. For instance, a restoration grant used to restore streamside riparian
areas should have an ongoing impact on stream turbidity by reducing erosion for
years after the project is finished. An OWEB education or outreach grant likewise is
expected to have an ongoing impact on stakeholder behavior in the watershed. Of
course, in the absence of ongoing maintenance efforts, the effect of restoration or
outreach actions likely dissipate or diminish over time. In other words, recording the
cumulative total of all grant funding is also inappropriate. To accommodate both the
potential for effects that last beyond the actual project duration and for effects that
diminish over time, I specify grant funding (for each category of grant) as a rolling
sum of active funds for three different time periods: one year, three years, and five

years.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="TScott_JPART_20143.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-8002f2"></a>
For instance, for the five-year metric, active grant funds in a given watershed in January 2005
are the sum of all monthly grant funds in that watershed between January 2000 and
January 2005. The three different specifications are compared below in the model
results.

<!--l. 154--><p class="noindent" >One of the advantages of the spatio-temporal model is that accounting for temporal and spatial
relationships between observations serves to address many of the factors that affect water
quality. For instance, more or less rainfall than is typical in a given year might affect water
quality scores by increasing or reducing water levels; grouping observations by time accounts
for this sort of variation. Likewise, the HUC8 random effects describe above account for local
characteristics that differ across watersheds, such as management institutions or population.
Several additional covariates are included in the model, however, in order to address factors
that are not accounted for by controlling for the relative location of an observation in space and
time.
<!--l. 156--><p class="indent" >   First, the western portion of Oregon in between the Pacific Ocean and the Cascade
Mountains receives much more rainfall than does the eastern portion and has a much different

climate. The distance between a given sample site and the coast makes a considerable difference
for observations. Thus, the model includes a variable measuring the Euclidean distance between
the sample site and the Oregon coast (mapped using geodata obtained from the Oregon
Geospatial Data Library).
<!--l. 158--><p class="indent" >   Further, land use and land cover are well established as key drivers of water quality (Tong
and Chen 2002; Meador and Goldstein 2003). Agricultural land usage is linked to
increased water chemical content (Skaggs et al. 1994; Johnes and Heathwaite 1997).
Waterways near developed land also demonstrate higher pollution levels (Wang
2001) (e.g., cars that leak oil onto pavement, which then washes into streams). To
calculate the proportion of each HUC8 watershed that this used for agricultural
purpose or that is developed, I use 30-meter by 30-meter raster (pixel image) data
from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The NLCD includes national land
cover data for 1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011. Using ArcGIS, I first produce a binary
True/False raster for each land cover type (agricultural land [cropland or pasture],
wetlands,<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="TScott_JPART_20144.html#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a

forest, and developed land), where each 30-meter by 30-meter pixel is coded as a 1 if that pixel
in the comprehensive NLCD raster corresponds to the designated land cover type, and a 0
otherwise. I then use the <span 
class="cmti-12">sp </span>(Pebesma and Bivand 2014) and <span 
class="cmti-12">raster </span>(Hijmans 2014) packages in
R to calculate the mean pixel value of all pixels within a 1000-meter radius surrounding each
sample site for each land cover type. The buffer zone land cover values calculated using the
1992 NLCD are then matched to water quality observations from 1995-2001, the 2001 NLCD
data to water quality observations from 2002 to 2005, the 2006 NLCD data to water
quality observations from 2006 to 2010, and the 2011 NLCD data to water quality
observations from 2010 to 2013. While it would be ideal to have more fine-grained
land cover data, perhaps on a yearly or quarterly basis, the NLCD data in this case
satisfy the purpose at hand; the absolute values are less important than having a

consistent way to account for relative differences in land usage amongst watersheds. I also
use elevation data obtained from the CGIAR Consortium for Spatial Information
using the R <span 
class="cmti-12">raster </span>package (Hijmans 2014) to control for the elevation of the sample
site.

<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >Before presenting results specifically pertaining to my hypotheses, I describe how
I fit these data into the Bayesian hierarchical model and identify the best-fitting
specification. All models are estimated using R (R Core Team, 2013) and the INLA package
developed by Rue et al. (2009). As described above, Bayesian models estimation
posterior parameter distributions; this implies that each parameter also has a prior
distribution. Since there are no prior data in this case, prior estimates are specified vaguely
using the default recommended INLA settings (Rue et al. 2009) and are said to be
non-informative priors (Gelman et al. 2013). This means that posterior estimates are
almost wholly generated in light of the data (i.e., the priors have little effect on the
posterior estimates). The spatial mesh used for the SPDE approach is shown in Figure
2:

<!--l. 172--><p class="indent" >   Water quality sampling stations can be used, but do not need to be, as triangle vertices in
the mesh (Lindgren et al. 2011). The mesh is more finely grained in areas where there are more
water quality sampling stations; larger triangles represent areas with little or no information
(Cosandey-Godin et al. 2014). Essentially, this serves so that the model estimates the field
with increased accuracy where there are sufficient data, and conversely does not
attempt to model the spatial random effect with great detail where there are no data.
This model feature is important, since as Figure 2 demonstrates, there are no water
quality sampling stations in much of eastern Oregon (in large part due to the fact that
there are much fewer streams in the eastern portion of the state) while sample sites
are highly concentrated in western Oregon. Figure 2 also shows that the mesh is
extended beyond the boundaries of the sample area; this is done to avoid boundary
effects wherein there is increased variance at the borders of a spatial field (since
locations near the field border have fewer surrounding values) (Lindgren and Rue
2013).
<!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   There are several possible methods by which to model spatio-temporal correlation posed by
Cosandey-Godin et al. (2014) that I compare: (Model 0) no spatial correlation; (Model
1) spatial correlation that is constant over time; (Model 2) spatial correlation that
has a different realization for each year; (Model 3) spatial correlation that is itself
correlated in consecutive years; (Model 4) spatial correlation that is repeated amongst
years, so that the correlation between 2000 and 2001 is the same as that between
2000 and 2007; (Model 5) spatial correlation that has a different realization for each
month; (Model 6) spatial correlation in which consecutive months in the same year are
correlated; and (Model 7) spatial correlation that is repeated amongst months in a
given year, so that the correlation between March 2007 and April 2007 is the same
as that between March 2007 and September 2007). Table &#x00A0;<a

<!--l. 178--><p class="indent" >   As Table &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: table:dicscores --></a> demonstrates, Model 3 has the smallest DIC value by far, indicating that it
provides the optimal method for modeling spatial correlation over time. Model three fits a
separate spatial correlation for each year (1995 through 2013), but assumes that the spatial
correlation between consecutive years is itself correlated. Relative to the some of the other
specifications, this makes a great deal of intuitive sense. First, spatial correlation refers
to the underlying spatial process assumed to present; while conditions at different
sites might vary considerably, the role that spatial distance plays in these conditions
likely remains relatively constant. Thus, it makes sense to model all months in a
given year as having the same spatial correlation function. Depending on broader
ecological, economic, or political changes, however, one might also expect to see
the role of spatial relationships change at least somewhat over 20 year period, as is
included in this analysis. Assuming that consecutive years are correlated (i.e., spatial
correlation in one year is very much like that of the following year), but allowing spatial
correlation to change over time accounts for such long-term, incremental changes.
As discussed above, the model also includes terms to capture temporal trends and
seasonal fluctuation. Figure 3 shows the smoothed time trend and seasonal trend fitted
as part of Model 3. It is interesting to note that overall, water quality appears to
fluctuate between 1995 and 2013 but there is no discernible upward or downward
trend.

typically considered in terms of a 12-month &#8220;water year,&#8221; and the 3-year and 5-year intervals to
potentially capture project impacts realized on a more long term basis. While as
mentioned above there are few data that explicitly concern the effects of collaborative

href="#x1-100043">3<!--tex4ht:ref: table:basecoefs --></a> are very
similar, as is expected given the similarity between the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year
metrics; each model has a lower DIC score than Model 3 above, evidencing that the

addition of grant funding does improve model fit. Note that each model in Table &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100043">3<!--tex4ht:ref: table:basecoefs --></a> also
includes an intercept and random effect terms for HUC8 watershed, time, season, and
space.

<!--l. 195--><p class="indent" >   One important issue to note with regards to Table &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100043">3<!--tex4ht:ref: table:basecoefs --></a> is that, as the reader will recognize,
the predicted effects of even well-known influencers of water quality such as agricultural land
usage are minimal. Similarly, while elevation and distance from the Pacific Ocean are expected
to be highly predictive of water quality, these coefficients are shown to be unimportant in this
model. The reason for this is that when one controls for spatial correlation, as in the SPDE
model, spatial correlation is not a phenomenon in and of itself, but rather is a proxy for
covariates that vary geographically such as elevation or land usage. Thus, these fixed
effects are blurred out due to&#8220;spatial confounding&#8221; (Hodges 2014). Likewise, fitting a
smoothed temporal term accounts not only long term climatic and environmental
changes, but also for social, political, and economic changes that might otherwise be
represented by time-varying covariates such as land usage. Simple hierarchical models,
particularly fit without the SPDE method, show each of these covariates to be highly
influential for water quality and of an expected sign (i.e., development and agriculture
are negatively linked to water quality, forest and elevation are positively linked to
water quality). It is interesting to note that developed land is negatively linked to
water quality in the non-spatial model, but positively linked to water quality once
spatial correlation is factored in, though why this is the case is unclear. Regardless of
covariate behavior, the models that account for spatial correlation explicitly are the best
predictive models (as shown by comparing Models 1 through 7 with Model 0 in Table
&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: table:dicscores --></a>).
<!--l. 197--><p class="indent" >   The implication of this issue is that controlling for spatial correlation makes it very
difficult to tease out the effects of any variable that is itself spatially distributed.
This includes not only the covariates discussed above, but also grant funds that are
distributed to particular watersheds and not others. In light of this, it is noteworthy that
Table &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100043">3<!--tex4ht:ref: table:basecoefs --></a> does show that increased grant funding is predictive of improved water
quality. This effect is strongest for grant funds expended in the 12 months prior to
the sample, where the middle 95% of the posterior distribution is between 1.001

and 1.008. In other words, net of all other terms in the model, a $100,000 in grant
funds received in the past year predicts a 0.1% to 0.8% increase in water quality
index score. This supports Hypothesis 1, that providing increased grant funding to
collaborative watershed councils serves to improve water quality. While magnitude of this
effect might seem very small at first glance, given: (a) the complexity of factors that
influence water quality; and (b) the indirect linkages between grant-funded projects and
conditions at sample observation sites, it is noteworthy that the model identifies this
relationship.
<!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >   The terms associated with 3 years and 5 years of prior grant receipts are also positive, but
the posterior distribution spans 1<span 
class="cmmi-12">.</span>000. This speaks to the question raised in the data and
modeling section concerning the temporal impact of grant projects. Table &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100043">3<!--tex4ht:ref: table:basecoefs --></a> indicates
that the effect of grant funds (considering all grants in total) are most pronounced
within 12 months of expenditure, and dissipate somewhat over time. It is important
to note that this does not necessarily mean that projects have only a short term
impact, but rather likely speaks the complexity of measuring environmental policy
impacts more generally: the further in time an observation is from a given policy
action, the more difficult it is to disentangle policy impacts from ecological trends
and other drivers. I continue to explore the temporal nature of grant funds in the
context of specific grant types below. I break down grant funds into four categories:
restoration, scientific and technical (grants labeled by OWEB as assessment, monitoring, or
technical assistance), and education and outreach (grants labeled by OWEB as either
and outreach or and educational project). Given that OWEB funds are allocated
competitively, it is unsurprising that different grant types are somewhat correlated.
Table presents the correlation for 12-month, 36-month, and 60-month rolling grant
sums.

<!--l. 203--><p class="indent" >   Since some of these value (especially for the longer time windows) are highly correlated, this
poses a multicollinearity problem for modeling. Thus, I fit a separate model for each grant
type, and summarize the resulting coefficients in Table &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100065">5<!--tex4ht:ref: table:diffgrants --></a>. Note that I also tested an
unrestricted model with all four grant types included; the resulting coefficients are
highly similar to that of the restricted individual models: the primary difference is
that while the posterior means are very similar, the posterior distributions are more
uncertain (as might be expected given the correlation between different grant type
funds).

<!--l. 207--><p class="indent" >   Table &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100065">5<!--tex4ht:ref: table:diffgrants --></a> shows that the mean parameter value for each type of grant funding is positive,
indicating (as expected) that grant funds of all kinds improve the impacts of watershed
councils. For the 12-month rolling sum, only grants for education and outreach projects have a
posterior parameter distribution for which the middle 95% of the distribution does not
encompass 1.000 (again bearing in mind that since water quality is log-transformed,
each coefficient is exponentiated and interpreted as a multiplicative factor). A $100k
increase in education and outreach grant funding within 12 months prior to the water
quality observation predicts a 6.8% increase in water quality at the mean parameter
value.
<!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >   Using the 36-month rolling sum as a measure of grant funds, all three non-restoration grant
types have posterior distributions where the middle 95% does not include 1.000. A $100k
increase in education and outreach funding increases water quality by an average of 3.7%, a
$100k increase in scientific and technical support or in council support both increase water
quality by an average of 0.9%. The results at the 60-month mark are similar, with a $100k
increase in education/outreach, scientific/technical, or council support increasing water quality
by an average of 2.6%, 0.9%, and 0.6%, respectively. In the section below, I discuss the
implications of these results.
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a>Discussion and Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 213--><p class="noindent" >Table &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100065">5<!--tex4ht:ref: table:diffgrants --></a> reveals an interesting pattern: the coefficient means decrease in magnitude (or
in two cases remain constant) as the time window for which grants are summed
increases, but the posterior distributions become more leptokurtic (i.e., narrower) and
fewer posterior distributions encompass 1<span 
class="cmmi-12">.</span>000. In other words, as the time window
increases, the environmental impact of all grants are estimated to be positive with
greater certainy, but the average impact is estimated to lessen. One likely reason
for the reduced uncertainty regarding estimated impacts is that the increased time

window provides a more consistent measure of ongoing council efforts. These data
assume a uniform monthly expenditure profile for the life of every grant type. In
practice, different projects (even within a single grant type) certainly have different
implementation and output profiles, both during and after the project period. Thus,
36-month and 60-month post expenditure time windows likely best capture all grant
expenditures at &#8220;full strength&#8221; (i.e., we can be more certain that each project has
run its course), explaining the narrower posterior distributions. The reason why the
mean estimates decrease as the time window increases in Table &#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100065">5<!--tex4ht:ref: table:diffgrants --></a> (and also in Table
&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-100043">3<!--tex4ht:ref: table:basecoefs --></a> for all grants combined) is likely due to the data and measurement approach
I employ. Water quality is a product of myriad complex factors, and so it follows
that the magnitude of any predicted grant impact should decrease over time simply
because there is greater opportunity for intervening factors. While it is possible that
the effects of certain projects do not diminish (or perhaps even increase) over time,
from a simple cause-and-effect standpoint the 36-month and 60-month time windows
place greater emphasis on projects much more distant to the actual water quality
observation.
<!--l. 215--><p class="indent" >   Measurement challenges also likely account for the fact that I do not identify a significant
measurable impact from spending on restoration projects, in spite of the preponderance of
ecological and environmental science demonstrating that restoration grants have an
environmental impact to one extent or another (assuming the project is conducted). These data
were not originally intended to serve the purpose of program evaluation. To best evaluate the
efficacy of a grant, one would need to follow up directly with an evaluation protocol that
explicitly monitors the outputs of grant-funded projects. However, such data collection efforts
would obviously be very costly and time-intensive; OWEB is not able to track impacts in such
detail or using comprehensive metrics that allow for comparison across the state. In lieu of
direct evaluatory data, I use existing Oregon water quality sampling stations, which are
selected independently of project sites. This best explains why I find the reverse of what I
hypothesize in Hypothesis 2 and do not find a measurable impact from restoration
grants. Identifying a measurable impact from restoration projects is particularly

challenging in this case because I am essentially selecting a stream point within an HUC8
watershed at random and testing whether spending on restoration projects within that
same watershed is associated with water quality at that site. If the sample site is
near to the actual restoration project site, then the impact might be clear; if the
sample site is nowhere near the project site, then measuring the impact is highly
unlikely.
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >   Conversely, these data are likely better suited for evaluating non-restoration projects, since
the nonpoint nature of many of these projects (in that restoration occurs at a specific site,
whereas an outreach project for instance attempts to influence stakeholder behavior at many
sites in the watershed) means the project impact has a broader spatial distribution in practice.
For instance, an outreach project might influence various individuals throughout the watershed,
and funds supporting council operations might be used to provide tools and services
that serve people and organizations throughout the watershed. A randomly selected
water quality sample site is more likely to be nearby a project site in this case there
are more &#8220;sites&#8221; involved. Generally speaking, the sampling approach of the OWQI
lends itself towards evaluating broader management efforts, not wholesale changes in
specific areas. In fact, the OWQI itself is billed explicitly as a tool for evaluating water
quality management effectiveness (Cude 2001). While the impact of a restoration
project might be very pronounced at or near the project site, these impacts are the
most difficult to assess using this model. Thus, while this analysis does support the
idea that watershed council actions have a meaningful impact on water quality, it is
important to emphasize that these results should not discredit the impact of restoration
activities.
<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >   The primary implication of these findings are that government investment in collaborative
management efforts, specifically providing funds to nonprofit watershed councils in this case,
can produce changes in environmental outcomes. Returning to the investment perspective
advanced above, I find that OWEBs investment in the production of non-environmental
outputs (e.g., educational programs, stakeholder meetings, monitoring and data collection) does
appears to engender an environmental return. The extant literature described in this paper

provides a great deal of theoretical support as to why governments might invest in
local nonprofit collaborative management groups. As evidenced by the considerable
funding governments provide to collaborative management bodies (e.g., Sabatier
et al. 2005), many practioners already assume the viability of this type of governance
approach. These data provide some of the first available evidence quantifying such
returns.
<!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >   More broadly, this research demonstrates the use of hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal
modeling as a means by which publicly available observational data produced by states and the
Federal government for environmental monitoring purposes can be repurposed to test
environmental policy theory and evaluate public environmental programs. While the results of
this analysis speak to the tradeoffs amongst different types of environmental projects, the
exploratory nature of this work is insufficient to provide direct guidance to policy makers
about how they should best allocate limited resources. Nonetheless, this provides a
basis for further inquiry. In particular, this analysis advances beyond the limiting
&#8220;collaborative&#8221; versus &#8220;non-collaborative&#8221; dichotomy to pose a more interesting and
relevant question: how should policymakers distribute resources between policies and
programs that produce environmental outputs at a relatively fixed input-output
ratio (e.g., restoration projects) and those that produce non-environmental outputs
(e.g., meetings, educational programs, administrative support) with the potential for
returns that exceed inputs (e.g., motivating landowners and resource users to take
restorative actions or modify their environmental behaviors in ways that far outstrip the
input level of the original outreach program)? Much additional work is needed to
understand how these different types of policies ultimately relate to environmental
outcomes.
