  <span

  <span

  <span 
class="cmr-10">take about 48 months to gain traction. However, what Leach et al. (2002) are in effect referring to</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">is the time it takes for groups to complete projects (particularly how long it takes for a newly</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">formed watershed council to begin to gain traction). In the case of projects funded by OWEB, each</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">grant-funded project has an inception date and a completion date; thus, there is a clear point at</span>
  <span 
class="cmr-10">which the project, for better, or worse, is finished, and there is no need to apply a temporal lag as</span>
  <span
